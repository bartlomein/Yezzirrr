The Soul has Bandaged moments – When too appalled to stir – She feels some ghastly Fright come up And stop to look at her –  Salute her, with long fingers – Caress her freezing hair – Sip, Goblin, from the very lips The Lover hovered o’er – Unworthy, that a thought so mean Accost a Theme so fair ­–  The soul has moments of escape – When bursting all the doors – She dances like a Bomb, abroad, And swings opon the Hours,  As do the Bee delirious borne – Long Dungeoned from his Rose – Touch Liberty then know no more, But Noon, and Paradise –  The Soul’s retaken moments – When, Felon led along, With shackles on the plumed feet, And staples, in the song,  The Horror welcomes her, again, These, are not brayed of Tongue – I heard a Fly buzz when I died   The Stillness in the Room Was like the Stillness in the Air   Between the Heaves of Storm   The Eyes around had wrung them dry   And Breaths were gathering firm For that last Onset when the King Be witnessed in the Room    I willed my Keepsakes Signed away What portions of me be Assignable and then it was There interposed a Fly    With Blue uncertain stumbling Buzz   Between the light and me   And then the Windows failed and then I could not see to see  Fame is a fickle food Upon a shifting plate Whose table once a Guest but not The second time is set   Whose crumbs the crows inspect And with ironic caw Flap past it to the Farmer’s Corn – Men eat of it and die  To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, One clover, and a bee  And revery  The revery alone will do, If bees are few  I measure every Grief I meet With narrow, probing, eyes  I wonder if It weighs like Mine  Or has an Easier size   I wonder if They bore it long  Or did it just begin  I could not tell the Date of Mine  It feels so old a pain   I wonder if it hurts to live  And if They have to try  And whether could They choose between  It would not be to die   I note that Some gone patient long  At length, renew their smile   An imitation of a Light That has so little Oil   I wonder if when Years have piled   Some Thousands on the Harm   That hurt them early such a lapse Could give them any Balm    Or would they go on aching still Through Centuries of Nerve  Enlightened to a larger Pain   In Contrast with the Love    The Grieved are many I am told   There is the various Cause   Death is but one and comes but once   And only nails the eyes    There’s Grief of Want and grief of Cold   A sort they call “Despair”   There’s Banishment from native Eyes  In sight of Native Air    And though I may not guess the kind   Correctly yet to me A piercing Comfort it affords In passing Calvary    To note the fashions of the Cross   And how they’re mostly worn   Still fascinated to presume That Some are like my own  I cannot live with You  It would be Life  And Life is over there  Behind the Shelf  The Sexton keeps the Key to  Putting up Our Life His Porcelain  Like a Cup   Discarded of the Housewife  Quaint or Broke  A newer Sevres pleases  Old Ones crack   I could not die with You  For One must wait To shut the Other’s Gaze down  You could not   And I could I stand by And see You freeze  Without my Right of Frost  Death’s privilege?  Nor could I rise with You  Because Your Face Would put out Jesus’  That New Grace  Glow plain and foreign On my homesick Eye  Except that You than He Shone closer by   They’d judge Us How  For You served Heaven You know, Or sought to  I could not   Because You saturated Sight  And I had no more Eyes For sordid excellence As Paradise  And were You lost, I would be  Though My Name Rang loudest On the Heavenly fame   And were You saved  And I condemned to be Where You were not  That self were Hell to Me   So We must meet apart  You there I here  With just the Door ajar That Oceans are and Prayer  And that White Sustenance  Despair  Therefore, this same world Uncomprehended by you must remain Uninfluenced by you  Women as you are, Mere women, personal and passionate, You give us doting mothers, and chaste wives  Sublime Madonnas, and enduring saints! We get no Christ from you,—and verily We shall not get a poet, in my mind    Thou hast nor youth nor age        But as it were an after dinner sleep        Dreaming of both         Here I am, an old man in a dry month,      Being read to by a boy, waiting for rain       I was neither at the hot gates      Nor fought in the warm rain      Nor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass,      Bitten by flies, fought       My house is a decayed house,      And the jew squats on the window sill, the owner,      Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp,      Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London       The goat coughs at night in the field overhead       Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds       The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,      Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter                          I an old man,      A dull head among windy spaces        Signs are taken for wonders  "We would see a sign":      The word within a word, unable to speak a word,      Swaddled with darkness  In the juvescence of the year      Came Christ the tiger       In depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas,      To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk      Among whispers  by Mr  Silvero      With caressing hands, at Limoges      Who walked all night in the next room       By Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians       By Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room      Shifting the candles  Fraulein von Kulp      Who turned in the hall, one hand on the door  Vacant shuttles      Weave the wind  I have no ghosts,      An old man in a draughty house      Under a windy knob        After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now      History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors      And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,      Guides us by vanities  Think now      She gives when our attention is distracted      And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions      That the giving famishes the craving  Gives too late      What's not believed in, or if still believed,      In memory only, reconsidered passion  Gives too soon      Into weak hands, what's thought can be dispensed with      Till the refusal propagates a fear  Think      Neither fear nor courage saves us  Unnatural vices      Are fathered by our heroism  Virtues      Are forced upon us by our impudent crimes       These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree        The tiger springs in the new year  Us he devours  Think at last      We have not reached conclusion, when I      Stiffen in a rented house  Think at last      I have not made this show purposelessly      And it is not by any concitation      Of the backward devils       I would meet you upon this honestly       I that was near your heart was removed therefrom      To lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition       I have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it      Since what is kept must be adulterated?      I have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch:      How should I use it for your closer contact?       These with a thousand small deliberations      Protract the profit of their chilled delirium,      Excite the membrane, when the sense has cooled,      With pungent sauces, multiply variety      In a wilderness of mirrors  What will the spider do,      Suspend its operations, will the weevil      Delay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs  Cammel, whirled      Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear      In fractured atoms  Gull against the wind, in the windy straits      Of Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,      White feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,      And an old man driven by the Trades      To a sleepy corner        Burbank crossed a little bridge      Descending at a small hotel       Princess Volupine arrived,      They were together, and he fell        Defunctive music under sea      Passed seaward with the passing bell      Slowly: the God Hercules      Had left him, that had loved him well        The horses, under the axletree      Beat up the dawn from Istria      With even feet  Her shuttered barge      Burned on the water all the day        But this or such was Bleistein's way:      A saggy bending of the knees      And elbows, with the palms turned out,      Chicago Semite Viennese        A lustreless protrusive eye      Stares from the protozoic slime      At a perspective of Canaletto       The smoky candle end of time       Declines  On the Rialto once       The rats are underneath the piles       The jew is underneath the lot       Money in furs  The boatman smiles,       Princess Volupine extends      A meagre, blue-nailed, phthisic hand      To climb the waterstair  Lights, lights,      She entertains Sir Ferdinand       Klein  Who clipped the lion's wings      And flea'd his rump and pared his claws?

He knew that thought clings round dead limbs      Tightening its lusts and luxuries        Donne, I suppose, was such another      Who found no substitute for sense       To seize and clutch and penetrate,      Expert beyond experience,       He knew the anguish of the marrow      The ague of the skeleton       No contact possible to flesh      Allayed the fever of the bone        I thought once how Theocritus had sung    Of the sweet years, the dear and wished-for years,    Who each one in a gracious hand appears    To bear a gift for mortals, old or young:    And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,    I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,    The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,    Those of my own life, who by turns had flung    A shadow across me   Straightway I was ’ware,    So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move    Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair     And a voice said in mastery, while I strove,—    “Guess now who holds thee!”—“Death,” I said, But, there,    The silver answer rang, “Not Death, but Love ”           But only three in all God’s universe    Have heard this word thou hast said,—Himself, beside    Thee speaking, and me listening! and replied    One of us       that was God,       and laid the curse    So darkly on my eyelids, as to amerce    My sight from seeing thee,—that if I had died,    The death-weights, placed there, would have signified    Less absolute exclusion   “Nay” is worse    From God than from all others, O my friend!    Men could not part us with their worldly jars,    Nor the seas change us, nor the tempests bend     Our hands would touch for all the mountain-bars:    And, heaven being rolled between us at the end,    We should but vow the faster for the stars            Unlike are we, unlike, O princely Heart!    Unlike our uses and our destinies     Our ministering two angels look surprise    On one another, as they strike athwart    Their wings in passing   Thou, bethink thee, art    A guest for queens to social pageantries,    With gages from a hundred brighter eyes    Than tears even can make mine, to play thy part    Of chief musician   What hast thou to do    With looking from the lattice-lights at me,    A poor, tired, wandering singer, singing through    The dark, and leaning up a cypress tree?    The chrism is on thine head,—on mine, the dew,—    And Death must dig the level where these agree            Thou hast thy calling to some palace-floor,    Most gracious singer of high poems! where    The dancers will break footing, from the care    Of watching up thy pregnant lips for more     And dost thou lift this house’s latch too poor    For hand of thine? and canst thou think and bear    To let thy music drop here unaware    In folds of golden fulness at my door?    Look up and see the casement broken in,    The bats and owlets builders in the roof!    My cricket chirps against thy mandolin     Hush, call no echo up in further proof    Of desolation! there’s a voice within    That weeps       as thou must sing       alone, aloof      V      I lift my heavy heart up solemnly,    As once Electra her sepulchral urn,    And, looking in thine eyes, I over-turn    The ashes at thy feet   Behold and see    What a great heap of grief lay hid in me,    And how the red wild sparkles dimly burn    Through the ashen greyness   If thy foot in scorn    Could tread them out to darkness utterly,    It might be well perhaps   But if instead    Thou wait beside me for the wind to blow    The grey dust up,       those laurels on thine head,    O my Belovëd, will not shield thee so,    That none of all the fires shall scorch and shred    The hair beneath   Stand further off then! go!           Go from me   Yet I feel that I shall stand    Henceforward in thy shadow   Nevermore    Alone upon the threshold of my door    Of individual life, I shall command    The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand    Serenely in the sunshine as before,    Without the sense of that which I forbore—    Thy touch upon the palm   The widest land    Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine    With pulses that beat double   What I do    And what I dream include thee, as the wine    Must taste of its own grapes   And when I sue    God for myself, He hears that name of thine,    And sees within my eyes the tears of two            The face of all the world is changed, I think,    Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul    Move still, oh, still, beside me, as they stole    Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink    Of obvious death, where I, who thought to sink,    Was caught up into love, and taught the whole    Of life in a new rhythm   The cup of dole    God gave for baptism, I am fain to drink,    And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear     The names of country, heaven, are changed away    For where thou art or shalt be, there or here     And this       this lute and song       loved yesterday,    (The singing angels know) are only dear    Because thy name moves right in what they say            What can I give thee back, O liberal    And princely giver, who hast brought the gold    And purple of thine heart, unstained, untold,    And laid them on the outside of the wall    For such as I to take or leave withal,    In unexpected largesse? am I cold,    Ungrateful, that for these most manifold    High gifts, I render nothing back at all?    Not so  not cold,—but very poor instead     Ask God who knows   For frequent tears have run    The colours from my life, and left so dead    And pale a stuff, it were not fitly done    To give the same as pillow to thy head     Go farther! let it serve to trample on            Can it be right to give what I can give?    To let thee sit beneath the fall of tears    As salt as mine, and hear the sighing years    Re-sighing on my lips renunciative    Through those infrequent smiles which fail to live    For all thy adjurations?  O my fears,    That this can scarce be right!  We are not peers    So to be lovers  and I own, and grieve,    That givers of such gifts as mine are, must    Be counted with the ungenerous   Out, alas!    I will not soil thy purple with my dust,    Nor breathe my poison on thy Venice-glass,    Nor give thee any love—which were unjust     Beloved, I only love thee! let it pass      X      Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed    And worthy of acceptation   Fire is bright,    Let temple burn, or flax  an equal light    Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:    And love is fire   And when I say at need    I love thee       mark!       I love thee—in thy sight    I stand transfigured, glorified aright,    With conscience of the new rays that proceed    Out of my face toward thine   There’s nothing low    In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures    Who love God, God accepts while loving so     And what I feel, across the inferior features    Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show    How that great work of Love enhances Nature’s            And therefore if to love can be desert,    I am not all unworthy   Cheeks as pale    As these you see, and trembling knees that fail    To bear the burden of a heavy heart,—    This weary minstrel-life that once was girt    To climb Aornus, and can scarce avail    To pipe now ’gainst the valley nightingale    A melancholy music,—why advert    To these things?  O Belovëd, it is plain    I am not of thy worth nor for thy place!    And yet, because I love thee, I obtain    From that same love this vindicating grace    To live on still in love, and yet in vain,—    To bless thee, yet renounce thee to thy face            Indeed this very love which is my boast,    And which, when rising up from breast to brow,    Doth crown me with a ruby large enow    To draw men’s eyes and prove the inner cost,—    This love even, all my worth, to the uttermost,    I should not love withal, unless that thou    Hadst set me an example, shown me how,    When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed,    And love called love   And thus, I cannot speak    Of love even, as a good thing of my own:    Thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak,    And placed it by thee on a golden throne,—    And that I love (O soul, we must be meek!)    Is by thee only, whom I love alone            And wilt thou have me fashion into speech    The love I bear thee, finding words enough,    And hold the torch out, while the winds are rough,    Between our faces, to cast light on each?—    I drop it at thy feet   I cannot teach    My hand to hold my spirits so far off    From myself—me—that I should bring thee proof    In words, of love hid in me out of reach     Nay, let the silence of my womanhood    Commend my woman-love to thy belief,—    Seeing that I stand unwon, however wooed,    And rend the garment of my life, in brief,    By a most dauntless, voiceless fortitude,    Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief            If thou must love me, let it be for nought    Except for love’s sake only   Do not say    “I love her for her smile—her look—her way    Of speaking gently,—for a trick of thought    That falls in well with mine, and certes brought    A sense of pleasant ease on such a day”—    For these things in themselves, Belovëd, may    Be changed, or change for thee,—and love, so wrought,    May be unwrought so   Neither love me for    Thine own dear pity’s wiping my cheeks dry,—    A creature might forget to weep, who bore    Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!    But love me for love’s sake, that evermore    Thou may’st love on, through love’s eternity            Accuse me not, beseech thee, that I wear    Too calm and sad a face in front of thine     For we two look two ways, and cannot shine    With the same sunlight on our brow and hair     On me thou lookest with no doubting care,    As on a bee shut in a crystalline     Since sorrow hath shut me safe in love’s divine,    And to spread wing and fly in the outer air    Were most impossible failure, if I strove    To fail so   But I look on thee—on thee—    Beholding, besides love, the end of love,    Hearing oblivion beyond memory     As one who sits and gazes from above,    Over the rivers to the bitter sea            And yet, because thou overcomest so,    Because thou art more noble and like a king,    Thou canst prevail against my fears and fling    Thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow    Too close against thine heart henceforth to know    How it shook when alone   Why, conquering    May prove as lordly and complete a thing    In lifting upward, as in crushing low!    And as a vanquished soldier yields his sword    To one who lifts him from the bloody earth,    Even so, Belovëd, I at last record,    Here ends my strife   If thou invite me forth,    I rise above abasement at the word     Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth!           My poet, thou canst touch on all the notes    God set between His After and Before,    And strike up and strike off the general roar    Of the rushing worlds a melody that floats    In a serene air purely   Antidotes    Of medicated music, answering for    Mankind’s forlornest uses, thou canst pour    From thence into their ears   God’s will devotes    Thine to such ends, and mine to wait on thine     How, Dearest, wilt thou have me for most use?    A hope, to sing by gladly? or a fine    Sad memory, with thy songs to interfuse?    A shade, in which to sing—of palm or pine?    A grave, on which to rest from singing?  Choose            I never gave a lock of hair away    To a man, Dearest, except this to thee,    Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully    I ring out to the full brown length and say    “Take it ”  My day of youth went yesterday     My hair no longer bounds to my foot’s glee,    Nor plant I it from roseor myrtle-tree,    As girls do, any more: it only may    Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,    Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside    Through sorrow’s trick   I thought the funeral-shears    Would take this first, but Love is justified,—    Take it thou,—finding pure, from all those years,    The kiss my mother left here when she died            The soul’s Rialto hath its merchandize     I barter curl for curl upon that mart,    And from my poet’s forehead to my heart    Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,—    As purply black, as erst to Pindar’s eyes    The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart    The nine white Muse-brows   For this counterpart,          The bay crown’s shade, Belovëd, I surmise,    Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black!    Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,    I tie the shadows safe from gliding back,    And lay the gift where nothing hindereth     Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack    No natural heat till mine grows cold in death            Belovëd, my Belovëd, when I think    That thou wast in the world a year ago,    What time I sat alone here in the snow    And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink    No moment at thy voice, but, link by link,    Went counting all my chains as if that so    They never could fall off at any blow    Struck by thy possible hand,—why, thus I drink    Of life’s great cup of wonder!  Wonderful,    Never to feel thee thrill the day or night    With personal act or speech,—nor ever cull    Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white    Thou sawest growing!  Atheists are as dull,    Who cannot guess God’s presence out of sight            Say over again, and yet once over again,    That thou dost love me   Though the word repeated    Should seem a “cuckoo-song,” as thou dost treat it,    Remember, never to the hill or plain,    Valley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain    Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed     Belovëd, I, amid the darkness greeted    By a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt’s pain    Cry, “Speak once more—thou lovest!”  Who can fear    Too many stars, though each in heaven shall roll,    Too many flowers, though each shall crown the year?    Say thou dost love me, love me, love me—toll    The silver iterance!—only minding, Dear,    To love me also in silence with thy soul            When our two souls stand up erect and strong,    Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,    Until the lengthening wings break into fire    At either curvëd point,—what bitter wrong    Can the earth do to us, that we should not long    Be here contented?  Think!  In mounting higher,    The angels would press on us and aspire    To drop some golden orb of perfect song    Into our deep, dear silence   Let us stay    Rather on earth, Belovëd,—where the unfit    Contrarious moods of men recoil away    And isolate pure spirits, and permit    A place to stand and love in for a day,    With darkness and the death-hour rounding it            Is it indeed so?  If I lay here dead,    Wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine?    And would the sun for thee more coldly shine    Because of grave-damps falling round my head?    I marvelled, my Belovëd, when I read    Thy thought so in the letter   I am thine—    But       so much to thee?  Can I pour thy wine    While my hands tremble?  Then my soul, instead    Of dreams of death, resumes life’s lower range     Then, love me, Love! look on me—breathe on me!    As brighter ladies do not count it strange,    For love, to give up acres and degree,    I yield the grave for thy sake, and exchange    My near sweet view of heaven, for earth with thee!           Let the world’s sharpness like a clasping knife    Shut in upon itself and do no harm    In this close hand of Love, now soft and warm,    And let us hear no sound of human strife    After the click of the shutting   Life to life—    I lean upon thee, Dear, without alarm,    And feel as safe as guarded by a charm    Against the stab of worldlings, who if rife    Are weak to injure   Very whitely still    The lilies of our lives may reassure    Their blossoms from their roots, accessible    Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer     Growing straight, out of man’s reach, on the hill     God only, who made us rich, can make us poor            A heavy heart, Belovëd, have I borne    From year to year until I saw thy face,    And sorrow after sorrow took the place    Of all those natural joys as lightly worn    As the stringed pearls, each lifted in its turn    By a beating heart at dance-time   Hopes apace    Were changed to long despairs, till God’s own grace    Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn    My heavy heart   Then thou didst bid me bring    And let it drop adown thy calmly great    Deep being!  Fast it sinketh, as a thing    Which its own nature does precipitate,    While thine doth close above it, mediating    Betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate            I lived with visions for my company    Instead of men and women, years ago,    And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know    A sweeter music than they played to me     But soon their trailing purple was not free    Of this world’s dust, their lutes did silent grow,    And I myself grew faint and blind below    Their vanishing eyes   Then thou didst come—to be,    Belovëd, what they seemed   Their shining fronts,    Their songs, their splendours, (better, yet the same,    As river-water hallowed into fonts)    Met in thee, and from out thee overcame    My soul with satisfaction of all wants:    Because God’s gifts put man’s best dreams to shame            My own Belovëd, who hast lifted me    From this drear flat of earth where I was thrown,    And, in betwixt the languid ringlets, blown    A life-breath, till the forehead hopefully    Shines out again, as all the angels see,    Before thy saving kiss!  My own, my own,    Who camest to me when the world was gone,    And I who looked for only God, found thee!    I find thee  I am safe, and strong, and glad     As one who stands in dewless asphodel,    Looks backward on the tedious time he had    In the upper life,—so I, with bosom-swell,    Make witness, here, between the good and bad,    That Love, as strong as Death, retrieves as well            My letters! all dead paper, mute and white!    And yet they seem alive and quivering    Against my tremulous hands which loose the string    And let them drop down on my knee to-night     This said,—he wished to have me in his sight    Once, as a friend: this fixed a day in spring    To come and touch my hand       a simple thing,    Yet I wept for it!—this,       the paper’s light          Said, Dear I love thee  and I sank and quailed    As if God’s future thundered on my past     This said, I am thine—and so its ink has paled    With lying at my heart that beat too fast     And this       O Love, thy words have ill availed    If, what this said, I dared repeat at last!           I think of thee!—my thoughts do twine and bud    About thee, as wild vines, about a tree,    Put out broad leaves, and soon there’s nought to see    Except the straggling green which hides the wood     Yet, O my palm-tree, be it understood    I will not have my thoughts instead of thee    Who art dearer, better!  Rather, instantly    Renew thy presence  as a strong tree should,    Rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare,    And let these bands of greenery which insphere thee,    Drop heavily down,—burst, shattered everywhere!    Because, in this deep joy to see and hear thee    And breathe within thy shadow a new air,    I do not think of thee—I am too near thee            I see thine image through my tears to-night,    And yet to-day I saw thee smiling   How    Refer the cause?—Belovëd, is it thou    Or I, who makes me sad?  The acolyte    Amid the chanted joy and thankful rite    May so fall flat, with pale insensate brow,    On the altar-stair   I hear thy voice and vow,    Perplexed, uncertain, since thou art out of sight,    As he, in his swooning ears, the choir’s amen     Belovëd, dost thou love? or did I see all    The glory as I dreamed, and fainted when    Too vehement light dilated my ideal,    For my soul’s eyes?  Will that light come again,    As now these tears come—falling hot and real?           Thou comest! all is said without a word     I sit beneath thy looks, as children do    In the noon-sun, with souls that tremble through    Their happy eyelids from an unaverred    Yet prodigal inward joy   Behold, I erred    In that last doubt! and yet I cannot rue    The sin most, but the occasion—that we two    Should for a moment stand unministered    By a mutual presence   Ah, keep near and close,    Thou dove-like help! and when my fears would rise,    With thy broad heart serenely interpose:    Brood down with thy divine sufficiencies    These thoughts which tremble when bereft of those,    Like callow birds left desert to the skies            The first time that the sun rose on thine oath    To love me, I looked forward to the moon    To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon    And quickly tied to make a lasting troth     Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe     And, looking on myself, I seemed not one    For such man’s love!—more like an out-of-tune    Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth    To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,    Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note     I did not wrong myself so, but I placed    A wrong on thee   For perfect strains may float    ’Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced,—    And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat            Yes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear    The name I used to run at, when a child,    From innocent play, and leave the cowslips plied,    To glance up in some face that proved me dear    With the look of its eyes   I miss the clear    Fond voices which, being drawn and reconciled    Into the music of Heaven’s undefiled,    Call me no longer   Silence on the bier,    While I call God—call God!—so let thy mouth    Be heir to those who are now exanimate     Gather the north flowers to complete the south,    And catch the early love up in the late     Yes, call me by that name,—and I, in truth,    With the same heart, will answer and not wait            With the same heart, I said, I’ll answer thee    As those, when thou shalt call me by my name—    Lo, the vain promise! is the same, the same,    Perplexed and ruffled by life’s strategy?    When called before, I told how hastily    I dropped my flowers or brake off from a game     To run and answer with the smile that came    At play last moment, and went on with me    Through my obedience   When I answer now,    I drop a grave thought, break from solitude     Yet still my heart goes to thee—ponder how—    Not as to a single good, but all my good!    Lay thy hand on it, best one, and allow    That no child’s foot could run fast as this blood            If I leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange    And be all to me?  Shall I never miss    Home-talk and blessing and the common kiss    That comes to each in turn, nor count it strange,    When I look up, to drop on a new range    Of walls and floors, another home than this?    Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is    Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change    That’s hardest   If to conquer love, has tried,    To conquer grief, tries more, as all things prove,    For grief indeed is love and grief beside     Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love     Yet love me—wilt thou?  Open thy heart wide,    And fold within, the wet wings of thy dove            When we met first and loved, I did not build    Upon the event with marble   Could it mean    To last, a love set pendulous between    Sorrow and sorrow?  Nay, I rather thrilled,    Distrusting every light that seemed to gild    The onward path, and feared to overlean    A finger even   And, though I have grown serene    And strong since then, I think that God has willed    A still renewable fear       O love, O troth          Lest these enclaspëd hands should never hold,    This mutual kiss drop down between us both    As an unowned thing, once the lips being cold     And Love, be false! if he, to keep one oath,    Must lose one joy, by his life’s star foretold            Pardon, oh, pardon, that my soul should make    Of all that strong divineness which I know    For thine and thee, an image only so    Formed of the sand, and fit to shift and break     It is that distant years which did not take    Thy sovranty, recoiling with a blow,    Have forced my swimming brain to undergo    Their doubt and dread, and blindly to forsake    Thy purity of likeness and distort    Thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit     As if a shipwrecked Pagan, safe in port,    His guardian sea-god to commemorate,    Should set a sculptured porpoise, gills a-snort    And vibrant tail, within the temple-gate            First time he kissed me, he but only kissed    The fingers of this hand wherewith I write     And ever since, it grew more clean and white     Slow to world-greetings, quick with its “O, list,”    When the angels speak   A ring of amethyst    I could not wear here, plainer to my sight,    Than that first kiss   The second passed in height    The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed,    Half falling on the hair   O beyond meed!    That was the chrism of love, which love’s own crown,    With sanctifying sweetness, did precede    The third upon my lips was folded down    In perfect, purple state  since when, indeed,    I have been proud and said, “My love, my own ”           Because thou hast the power and own’st the grace    To look through and behind this mask of me,    (Against which, years have beat thus blanchingly,    With their rains,) and behold my soul’s true face,    The dim and weary witness of life’s race,—    Because thou hast the faith and love to see,    Through that same soul’s distracting lethargy,    The patient angel waiting for a place    In the new Heavens,—because nor sin nor woe,    Nor God’s infliction, nor death’s neighbourhood,    Nor all which others viewing, turn to go,    Nor all which makes me tired of all, self-viewed,—    Nothing repels thee,       Dearest, teach me so    To pour out gratitude, as thou dost, good!           Oh, yes! they love through all this world of ours!    I will not gainsay love, called love forsooth:    I have heard love talked in my early youth,    And since, not so long back but that the flowers    Then gathered, smell still   Mussulmans and Giaours    Throw kerchiefs at a smile, and have no ruth    For any weeping   Polypheme’s white tooth    Slips on the nut if, after frequent showers,    The shell is over-smooth,—and not so much    Will turn the thing called love, aside to hate    Or else to oblivion   But thou art not such    A lover, my Belovëd! thou canst wait    Through sorrow and sickness, to bring souls to touch,    And think it soon when others cry “Too late ”           I thank all who have loved me in their hearts,    With thanks and love from mine   Deep thanks to all    Who paused a little near the prison-wall    To hear my music in its louder parts    Ere they went onward, each one to the mart’s    Or temple’s occupation, beyond call     But thou, who, in my voice’s sink and fall    When the sob took it, thy divinest Art’s    Own instrument didst drop down at thy foot    To harken what I said between my tears,          Instruct me how to thank thee!  Oh, to shoot    My soul’s full meaning into future years,    That they should lend it utterance, and salute    Love that endures, from life that disappears!           My future will not copy fair my past—    I wrote that once  and thinking at my side    My ministering life-angel justified    The word by his appealing look upcast    To the white throne of God, I turned at last,    And there, instead, saw thee, not unallied    To angels in thy soul!  Then I, long tried    By natural ills, received the comfort fast,    While budding, at thy sight, my pilgrim’s staff    Gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled     I seek no copy now of life’s first half:    Leave here the pages with long musing curled,    And write me new my future’s epigraph,    New angel mine, unhoped for in the world!           How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways     I love thee to the depth and breadth and height    My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight    For the ends of Being and ideal Grace     I love thee to the level of everyday’s    Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight     I love thee freely, as men strive for Right     I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise     I love thee with the passion put to use    In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith     I love thee with a love I seemed to lose    With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,    Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose,    I shall but love thee better after death            Belovëd, thou hast brought me many flowers    Plucked in the garden, all the summer through,    And winter, and it seemed as if they grew    In this close room, nor missed the sun and showers     So, in the like name of that love of ours,    Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too,    And which on warm and cold days I withdrew    From my heart’s ground   Indeed, those beds and bowers    Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue,    And wait thy weeding  yet here’s eglantine,    Here’s ivy!—take them, as I used to do    Thy flowers, and keep them where they shall not pine     Instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true,    And tell thy soul, their roots are left in mine     Like arabesques of ebony,     The cypresses, in silhouette,     Fantastically cleave and fret     A moon of yellow ivory       The coldly colored rays illume     A leafy pattern manifold,     And all the field is overscrolled     With curiously figured gloom       Like arabesques of ebony,     Or like Arabian lattices,     Forever seem the cypresses     Before a moon of ivory                Beyond the far Cathayan wall,     A thousand leagues athwart the sky,     The scarlet stars and mornings die,     The gilded moons and sunsets fall       Across the sulphur-colored sands     With bales of silk the camels fare,     Harnessed with vermil and with vair,     Into the blue and burning lands       And, ah, the song the drivers sing,     To while the desert leagues away—     A song they sang in old Cathay,     Ere youth had left the eldest king,—      Ere love and beauty both grew old,     And wonder and romance were flown     On fiery wings to worlds unknown,     To stars of undiscovered gold       And I their alien words would know,     And follow past the lonely Wall,     Where gilded moons and sunsets fall,     As in a song of long ago               Omar, within thy scented garden-close,     When passed with eventide     The starward incense of the waning rose—     Too fair and dear and precious to abide     After the glad and golden death of spring—     Omar, thou heardest then,     Above the world of men,     The mournful rumour of an iron wing,     The sough and sigh of desolating years,     Whereof the wind is as the winds that blow     Out of a lonesome land of night and snow,     Where ancient winter weeps with frozen tears      And in thy bodeful ears,     The brief and tiny lisp     Of petals curled and crisp,     Fallen at Eve in Persia’s mellow clime,     Was mingled with the mighty sound of time       Omar, thou knewest well     How the fair days are sorrowful and strange     With time’s inexorable mystery     And terror ineluctable of change:     Upon thine eyes the bleak and bitter spell     Of vision, thou didst see,     As in a magic glass,     The moulded mists and painted shadows pass—     The ghostly pomps we name reality      And, lo, the level field,     With broken fane and throne,     And dust of old, unfabled cities sown,     In unremembering years was made to yield,     From out the shards of Pow’r,     The pillars frail and small     That lift for capital     The blood-like bubble of the poppy-flow’r      And crowns were crumbled for the airy gold     The crocus and the daffodil should hold     As inalienable dow’r      Before thy gaze, the sad unvaried green     The cypresses like robes funereal wear,     Was woven on the gradual looms of air,     From threadbare silk and tattered sendaline     That clothed some ancient queen      And from the spoilt vermilion of her mouth,     The myrtles rose, and from her ruined hair,     And eyes that held the summer’s ardent drouth     In blown, forgotten bow’rs      And amber limbs and breast,     Through ancient nights by sleepless love oppressed,     Or by the iron flight of loveless hours       Knowing the weary wisdom of the years,     The empty truth of tears      The suns of June, that with some great excess     Of ardour slay the unabiding rose,     And grey-haired winter, wan and fervourless     For whom no flower grows      Seeing the scarlet and the gold that pales,     On Orient snows untrod,     In magic morns that grant,     Across a land of common green and gray,     The disenchanted day      Knowing the iron veils     And walls of adamant,     That ward the flaming verities of God—     Knowing these things, ah, surely thou wert wise,     Beneath the warm and thunder-dreaming skies,     To kiss on ardent breast and avid mouth,     Some girl whose sultry eyes     Were golden with the sun-beloved south—     To pluck the rose and drain the rose-red wine,     In gardens half-divine      Before the broken cup     Be filled and covered up     In dusty seas of everlasting drouth             O love, thy lips are bright and cold,     Like jewels carven curiously     To symbols of a mystery,     A secret dim, forgotten, old       Like woven amber, finely spun,     Thy hair, enwoofed with golden light,     Remembers yet the flaming flight     Of some unknown, archaic sun       Thine eyes are crystals green and chill,     Wherein, as in a shifting sea,     Wan fires and drowning splendours flee     To stealthy deeps forever still       Fallen across thy dreaming face,     The dawn is made a secret thing,     Like flame of crimson lamps that swing     At midnight, in a cavern-space       Thy smile is like the furtive gleam     Of fleeing moons a traveller sees     Through closing arms of cypress-trees,     In secret realms of night and dream       Sphinx-like, unsolved eternally,     Thy beauty’s riddle doth abide,     And love hath come, and love hath died,     Striving to read the mystery               In years no vision shall aver,     In lands no dream may name,     Tow’rd alien things what longings were,     And thence what languors came!      For each horizon straightly sought,     With fealty to the stars,     What death and weariness were bought,     What bitterness, what bars!             *       *       *       *       *      I waken unto years afar,     And find the quest made new     In Earth, that was perchance a star     Unto my former view              The secret rose we vainly dream to find,     Was blown in grey Atlantis long ago,     Or in old summers of the realms of snow,     Its attar lulled the pole-arisen wind      Or once its broad and breathless petals pined     In gardens of Persepolis, aglow     With desert sunlight, and the fiery, slow     Red waves of sand, invincible and blind       On orient isles, or isles hesperian,     Through mythic days ere mortal time began,     It flowered above the ever-flowering foam      Or, legendless, in lands of yesteryear,     It flamed among the violets—near, how near,     To unenchanted fields and hills of home!             Her face the sinking stars desire      Unto her place the slow deeps bring     Shadow of errant winds that wing     O’er sterile gulfs of foam and fire       Her beauty is the light of pearls      All stars and dreams and sunsets die     To make the fluctuant glooms that lie     Around her, and low noonlight swirls      Down ocean’s firmamental deep,     To weave for her who glimmers there,     Elusive visions, vague and fair      And night is as a dreamless sleep:      She has not known the night’s unrest,     Nor the white curse of clearer day      The tremors of the tempest play     Like slow delight about her breast       Serene, an immanence of fire,     She dwells forever, ocean-thralled,     Soul of the sea’s vast emerald      Her face the sinking stars desire              Upon the seas of Saturn I have sailed     To isles of high, primeval amarant,     Where the flame-tongued sonorous flow’rs enchant     The hanging surf to silence: All engrailed      With ruby-colored pearls, the golden shore     Allured me  but as one whom spells restrain,     For blind horizons of the sombre main,     And harbors never known, my singing prore      I set forthrightly: Formed of fire and brass,     Immenser skies divided, deep on deep     Before me,—till, above the darkling foam,      With dome on cloudless adamantine dome,     Black peaks no peering seraph deems to pass,     Rose up from realms ineffable as Sleep!            The silver silence of the moon     Upon the sleeping garden lies      The wind of evening dies,     As in forgetful dreams a ghostly tune       How white, how still, the flowers are,     As carved of pearl and ivory!     The pines are ebony,     A sombre frieze on heavens pale and far       Like mirrors made of lucid stone,     The pools lie calm, and bright, and cold,     Where moon and stars behold,     In some eternal trance, themselves alone              Lo, for Earth’s manifest monotony     Of ordered aspect unto sun and star,     And single moon, I turn to years afar,     And ampler worlds ensphered in memory       There, to the zoned and iris-differing light     Of three swift suns in heavens of vaster range,     Transcendant Beauty knows a trinal change,     And dawn and eve are in the place of night       There, long ago, in mornings ocean-green,     I saw bright deserts dusky with the sky,     Or under yellow noons, wide waters lie     Like wrinkled bronze made hot with fires unseen       Strange flow’rs that bloom but to an azure sun,     I saw  and all complexities of light     That work fantastic magic on the sight,     Wrought unimagined marvels one by one       There, swifter shadows suffer gorgeous dooms—     Lost in an orange noon, an azure morn      At twofold eve, large, winged lights are born,     Towering to meet the dawn, or briefest glooms      Of chrysoberyl filled with wondering stars,     Draw from an emerald east to skies of gold      Tow’rd jasper waters leaning to behold,     Vague moons are lost amid great nenuphars             It seems to me that I have lived alone—     Alone, as one that liveth in a dream:     As light on coldest marble, or the gleam     Of moons eternal on a land of stone,     The dawns have been to me  I have but known     The silence of a frozen land extreme—     A sole attending silence, all supreme     As is the sea’s enormous monotone       Upon the icy desert of my days,     No bright mirages are, but iron rays     Of dawn relentless, and the bitter light     Of all-revealing noon **** Alone, I crave     The friendly clasp of finite arms, to save     My spirit from the ravening Infinite              Beauty, thou orchid of immortal bloom,     Sprung from the fire and dust of perished spheres,     How art thou tall in these autumnal years     With the red rain of immemorial doom,     And fragrant where but lesser suns illume,     For sustenance of Life’s forgotten tears!     Ever thy splendour and thy light appears     Like dawn from out the midnight of the tomb       Colours, and gleams, and glamours unrecalled,     Richly thy petals intricate revive:     Blossom, whose roots are in Eternity,     The faithful soul, the sentience darkly thralled,     In dream and wonder evermore shall strive     At Edens lost of time and memory      A        Autumn far-off in memory,     That saw the crisping myrtles fade!****     Aeons agone, my tomb was made,     Beside the moon-constrainèd sea       Ah, wonderful its portals were!     With carven doors of chrysolite,     And walls of sombre syenite,     They wrought mine olden sepulchre!      About the griffin-guarded plinth,     White blossoms crowned the scarlet vine      And burning orchids opaline     Illumed the palm and terebinth       On friezes of mine ancient fame,     The cypress wrought its writhen shade      And through the boughs the ocean made     Moresques of blue and fretted flame       Poet or prince, I may not know     My perished name, nor bring to mind     Years that are one with dust and wind,     Nor songless love, and tongueless woe—:      Only the tomb they made for me,     With carven doors of chrysolite,     And walls of sombre syenite,     Beside the moon-constrainèd sea             The sunset-gonfalons are furled     On plains of evening, broad and pale,     And, wov’n athwart the waning world,     The air is like a silver veil       Into the thin and trembling gloom,     That holds a hueless warp of light,     The murmuring wind on a slow loom,     Weaves the rich purples of the night             Grey hells, or hells aglow with hot and scarlet flow’rs      White hells of light and clamour  hells the abomination     Of breathless, deep sepulchral desolation     Oppresses ever—I have known them all, through hours     Tedious as dead eternity  where timeless pow’rs,     Leagued in malign, omnipotent persuasion—     Wearing the guise of love, despair and aspiration,     Forever drove, through ashen fields and burning bow’rs,      My soul that found no sanctuary **** For Lucifer,     And all the weary, proud, imperious, baffled ones     Made in his image, hell is anywhere: The ice     Of hyperboreal deserts, or the blowing spice     In winds from off Sumatra, for each wanderer     Preserves the jealous flame of sad, infernal suns             Mirrors of steel or silver, gold or glass antique!     Whether in melancholy marble palaces     In some long trance you drew the dreamy loveliness     Of Roman queens, or queens barbarical, or Greek      Or, further than the bright and sun-pursuing beak     Of argosy might fare, beheld the empresses     Of lost Lemuria  or behind the lattices     Alhambran, have returned forbidden smiles oblique      Of wan, mysterious women!—Mirrors, mirrors old,     Mirrors immutable, impassable as Fate,     Your bosoms held the perished beauty of the past     Nearer than straining love might ever hope to hold      And fleeing faces, lips too phantom-frail to last,     Found in your magic depth a life re-duplicate              Ah, woe is me, for Love hath lain asleep,     Hath lain too long in some Morphean close,—     Till on his dreaming wings the ruined rose     Fell lightly, and the rose-red leaves were deep       Alas, alas, for Love is overlate!     Far-wandering, alone, we know not where,     He found the white and purple poppies fair,     Nor heard the Summer pass importunate       Ah, Love, can we forgive thy loitering?     The golden Summer, as a dream foregone     Is changed—till in our eyes the ashen dawn     Of Autumn kindles **** We have heard thy wing     But with a sound of sighing  heart on heart,     In our own sighs we hear thy wing depart                 O, Muse, where lingerest thou? In any land     Of Saturn, lit with moons and nenuphars?     Or in what high metropolis of Mars—     Hearing the gongs of dire, occult command,     And bugles blown from strand to unknown strand     Of continents embattled in old wars     That primal kings began? Or on the bars     Of ebbing seas in Venus, from the sand     Of shattered nacre with a thousand hues,     Dost pluck the blossoms of the purple wrack     And roses of blue coral for thy hair?     Or, flown beyond the roaring Zodiac,     Translatest thou the tale of earthly news     And earthly songs to singers of Altair?            The harsh, brief sob of broken horns  the sound     Of hammers, on some echoing sepulchre      Lutes in a thunderstorm  a dulcimer     By sudden drums and clamouring bugles drowned      Crackle of pearls, and gritting rubies, ground     Beneath an iron heel  the heavy whirr     Of battle wheels  a hungry leopard’s purr,     And sigh of swords withdrawing from the wound—:      All, all are in thy dreadful fugue, O Life,     Thy dark, malign and monstrous music, spun     In hell, from a delirious Satan’s dream!***     O! dissonance primordial and supreme—     The moan, the thunder, evermore at strife,     Beneath the unheeding silence of the sun!               Importunate, the lion-throated sea,     Blind with the mounting foam of winter, mourns     To cliffs where cling the wrenched and laboured roots     Of cypresses, and blossoms granite-grown     Lose in the gale their tattered petals, cast     On bleak, tumultuous cauldrons of the tide,     Where fell thy molten ashes **** Past the bay,     The morning dunes a dust of marble seem—     Wrought from primeval fanes to Beauty reared,     And shattered by some vandal Titan’s mace     To more than Time’s own ruin  Woods of pine,     Above the dunes in Gothic gloom recede,     And climb the ridge that arches to the north     Long as a lolling dragon’s chine  The gulls,     Like ashen leaves far-off upon the wind,     Flutter above the broad and smouldering sea,     That lightens with the fire-white foam: But thou,     Of whom the sea is urn and sepulcher,     Who hast thereof a blown, tumultuous sleep,     And stormy peace in gulfs impacable—     What carest thou if Beauty loiter there,     Clad with the crystal noon? What carest thou     If sharp and sudden balsams of the pine     Mingle for her in the air’s bright thurible     With keener fragrance proffered by the deep     From riven gulfs resounding?*** Knowest thou     What solemn shores of crocus-colored light,     Reared by the sunset in its realm of change,     Will mock the dream-lost isles that sirens ward,     And charm the icy emerald of the seas     To unabiding iris? Knowest thou     The waxing of the wan December foam—     A thunder-cloven veil that climbs and falls     Upon the cliffs forever?                            Thou art still     As they that sleep in the eldest pyramid—     Or mounded with Mesopotamia     And immemorial deserts! Thou hast part     In the wordless, dumb conspiracy of death—     Silence wherein the warrior kings accord,     And all the wrangling sages! If thy voice     In any wise return, and word of thee,     It is a lost, incognizable sigh,     Upon the wind’s oblivious woe, or blown,     Antiphonal, from wave to plangent wave     In the vast, unhuman sorrow of the main,     On tides that lave the city-laden shores     Of lands wherein the eternal vanities     Are served at many altars  tides that wash     Lemuria’s unfathomable walls,     And idly sway the weed-involvèd oars     At wharves of lost Atlantis  tides that rise     From coral-coffered bones of all the drowned,     And sunless tombs of pearl that krakens guard                                             As none shall roam the sad Leucadian rock,     Above the sea’s immitigable moan,     But in his heart a song that Sappho sang,     And flame-like murmur of the muted lyres     That time hath not extinguished, and the cry     Of nightingales two thousand years ago,     Shall mix with those remorseful chords that break     To endless foam and thunder  and he learn     The unsleeping woe that lives in Mytelene     Till wave and deep are dumb with ice, and rime     Hath paled the rose forever—even thus,     Daughter of Sappho, passion-souled and fair,     Whose face the lutes of Lesbos would have sung,     And white Errina followed—even thus,     The western wave is eloquent of thee,     And half the wine-like fragrance of the foam     Is attar of thy spirit, and the pines     From breasts of mournful, melancholy green,     Release remembered echoes of thy song     To airs importunate  No wraith of fog,     Twice-ghostly with the Hecatean moon,     Nor rack of blown, fantasmal spume shall rise,     But I will dream thy spirit walks the sea,     Unpacified with Lethe  Thou art grown     A part of all sad beauty, and my soul     Hath found thy buried sorrow in its own,     Inseparable forever  Moons that pass,     Immaculate, to solemn pyres of snow,     And meres whereon the broken lotus dies,     Are kin to thee, as wine-lipped autumn is,     With suns of swift, irreparable change,     And lucid evenings eager-starred  Of thee,     The pearlèd fountains tell, and winds that take     In one white swirl the petals of the plum,     And leave the branches lonely  Royal blooms     Of the magnolia, pale as Beauty’s brow,     And foam-white myrtles, and the fiery, bright     Pome-granate flow’rs, will subtly speak of thee     While spring hath speech and meaning  Music hath     Her fugitive and uncommanded chords,     That thrill with tremors of thy mystery,     Or turn the void thy fleeing soul hath left     To murmurs inenarrable, that hold     Epiphanies of blind, conceiveless vision,     And things we dare not know, and dare not dream      Rememberest thou? Enormous gongs of stone     Were stricken, and the storming trumpeteers     Acclaimed my deed to answering tides of spears,     And spoke the names of monsters overthrown—     Griffins whose angry gold, and fervid store     Of sapphires wrenched from marble-plungèd mines—     Carnelians, opals, agates, almandines,     I brought to thee some scarlet eve of yore       In the wide fane that shrined thee, Venus-wise,     The fallen clamours died **** I heard the tune     Of tiny bells of pearl and melanite,     Hung at thy knees, and arms of dreamt delight      And placed my wealth before thy fabled eyes,     Pallid and pure as jaspers from the moon             Ah, more to me than many days and many dreams     And more than every hope, or any memory,     This moment, when thy lips are laid immortally     On mine, and death and time are shadows of old dreams       Now all the crownless, ruined years have recompense:     In one supreme, undying hour of light and fire,     The many moons and suns have found their one desire—     When in the hour of love, all life has recompense             Thy mouth is like a crimson orchid-flow’r,     Whence perfume and whence poison rise unseen     To moons aswim in iris or in green,     Or mix with morning in an eastern bow’r       Thou shouldst have known, in amaranthine isles,     The sunsets hued like fire of frankincense,     Or the long noons enfraught with redolence,     The mingled spicery of purple miles       Thy breasts, where blood and molten marble flow,     Thy warm white limbs, thy loins of tropic snow—     These, these, by which desire is grown divine,      Were made for dreams in mystic palaces,     For love, and sleep, and slow voluptuousness,     And summer seas a-foam like foaming wine             To look on love with disenamoured eyes      To see with gaze relentless, rendered clear     Of hope or hatred, of desire and fear,     The insuperable nullity that lies     Behind the veils of various disguise     Which life or death may haply weave  to hear     Forevermore in flute and harp the mere     And all-resolving silence  recognize     The gules of autumn in the greening leaf,     And in the poppy-pod the poppy-flow’r—     This is to be the lord of love and grief,     O’er Time’s illusion and thyself supreme,     As, half-aroused in some nocturnal hour,     The dreamer knows and dominates his dream             Dear you were as is the tree of Being     To the happy dead in heaven’s bow’rs ****     Whence and what, this evil spell that flings me     Forth from love with loveless eyes unseeing?      Fair you were as nymph or queen of vision—     Bosomed like the succubi of dreams ****     All your beauty turns to sad, ironic     Weariness, and sorrowful derision       Lo, of what avail our spent caresses,—     Kisses that set the summer night aflame?****     Mute, enormous languor without cause—     What is this my autumn heart confesses?      All your breast was fragrant like the flowers     Of the grape on hills toward the south ****     Love is acrid now like staling asters,     Sodden with the rain of autumn hours                The glories and the perils of thy day     Are one, O Man! Thou goest to thine end     With Pow’rs, and for a little thou dost wend     With marshalled Majesties upon their way:     But thee the dread Necessities betray     That nurse, and fearful Splendours that befriend      And thee shall alien Dominations rend ****     Deemest the triumph of the worlds to stay,     Or step by step eternal, unsurpassed,     Stride with the suns upon their road of awe?     Thou travelest brief ways that end and sink—     Urged by the hurrying planets  and the vast,     Prone-rushing constellations of the Law,     Thunder and press behind thee at the brink             Thy heart will not believe in love:     Therefore is love become to me     A dream, an empty mockery,     And death and life are less than love       O, bright and beautiful as flame     Thy hair, and pale thy lips, and eyes     Like seas wherein the waning skies     Of autumn lie in paler flame       Forevermore thy heart abides,     A dreaming crystal, pure and cold,     Amid whose visions manifold     No shape nor any shade abides       Thy days are void and vain as death:     The moons and morrows weave for thee     A sleep of light eternally,     Where life is as a dream of death       Chill as white jewels, or the moon,     And virginal as ice or fire,     Thou knowest life and life’s desire     As a bright mirror knows the moon       Lo, if thy heart believed in love,     It were not more nor less to me:     I know  love a mockery,     And all my dreams less vain than love               Dreaming, I said,  “When she is come,     This desert garden that is me,     For her shall offer mellowly     Its myrrh and its olibanum—     When she is come       “The flowers of the moon for her,     With blossoms of the sun shall bloom,     The fading roses breathe perfume,     The lightly fallen petals stir,     And sigh to her         “Her presence, like a living wind     Each little leaf makes visible,     Shall enter there, or like the spell     (Upon the lulling leaves divined)     Of silent wind ”             *       *       *       *       *      Alas! for she is come and gone,     And in the garden, green for her,     The flowers fall, the flowers stir     Only to winds of night and dawn:     For she is gone                Because of thee, immortal Love hath died:     Because thy wilful heart will not believe,     Thy hands and mine a thorny crown must weave,     A thorny crown for Love the crucified       Behold, how beautiful the limbs that bleed—     The limbs that bleed, O stubborn heart, for us!     Still are the lids so softly tremulous,     And mute the mouth of our eternal need              *       *       *       *       *      Though this thy fearful lips would now deny,     Love is divine, and cannot wholly die:     Draw forth the nails thy tender hands have driven—      And we will know the mercy infinite,     Will find redemption in our own delight,     And in each other’s heart the only heaven              Against my heart your heart is closed  you bid me go:     What ways are left in all the world for Love to know?     Desolate oceans, and the light of lonely plains,     Dead moons that wander in the wastes of ice and snow—      These, these I fain would see, and find the splendid bourne     Of sunset, or the brazen deserts of the morn,     That I might lose this ever-aching loneliness     In vaster solitude  and love be less forlorn,      Faring to seek with alien sun and alien star     The strange, the veiled horizons infinite and far      Spaces of fire and night, the skies of steel and gold,     Or sunset-haunted seas where foamless islands are               Black dreams  the pale and sorrowful desire     Whose eyes have looked on Lethe, and have seen,     Deep in the sliding ebon tide serene,     Their own vain light inverted  ashen fire,     With wasted lilies, late and languishing      Autumnal roses blind with rain  slow foam     From desert-sinking seas, with honeycomb     Of aconite and poppy—these I bring     With this my bitter, barren love to thee      And from the grievous springs of memory,     Far in the great Maremma of my heart,     I proffer thee to drink  and on thy mouth,     With the one kiss wherein we meet and part,     Leave fire and dust from quenchless leagues of drouth             The ghostly fire that walks the fen,     Tonight thine only light shall be      On lethal ways thy soul shall pass,     And prove the stealthy, coiled morass,     With mocking mists for company       On roads thou goest not again,     To shores where thou hast never gone,—     Fare onward, though the shuddering queach     And serpent-rippled waters reach     Like seepage-pools of Acheron,      Beside thee  and the twisten reeds,     Close-raddled as a witch’s net,     Enwind thy knees, and cling and clutch     Like wreathing adders  though the touch     Of the blind air be dank and wet,      As from a wounded Thing that bleeds     In cloud and darkness overhead—     Fare onward, where thy dreams of yore     In splendour drape the fetid shore     And pestilential waters dead       And though the toads’ irrision rise,     As grinding of Satanic racks,     And spectral willows, gaunt and grey,     Gibber along thy shrouded way,     Where vipers lie with livid backs,      And watch thee with their sulphurous eyes,—     Fare onward, till thy feet shall slip     Deep in the sudden pool ordained,     And all the noisome draught be drained,     That turns to Lethe on the lip                O lovely demon, half-divine!     Hemlock, and hydromel, and gall,     Honey, and aconite, and wine,     Mingle to make that mouth of thine—      Thy mouth I love: But most of all,     It is thy tears that I desire—     Thy tears, like fountain-drops that fall     In gardens red, Satanical       Or like the tears of mist and fire,     Wept by the moon, that wizards use     To secret runes, when they require     Some silver philtre, sweet and dire      A        With words of ivory,     Of bronze, of ebony,     Of alabaster, marble, steel, and gold,     The beauty of the visible is told       But how with these express     The unseen Loveliness—     Splendour and light, and harmony, and sound,     The heart hath felt, the sense hath never found?      No shining words of stone—     Shadow and cloud alone—     These shall the poet seek eternally,     Whose lines would carve the mask of Mystery              The years are a falling of snow,     Slow, but without cessation,     On hills, and mountains, and flowers and worlds that were      But snow, and the crawling night wherein it fell,     May be washed away in one swifter hour of flame:     Thus it was that some slant of sunset     In the chasms of pilèd cloud—     Transient mountains that made a new horizon,     Uplifting the west to fantastic pinnacles—     Smote warm in a buried realm of the spirit,     Till the snows of forgetfulness were gone      Clear in the vistas of memory,     The peaks of a world long unremembered,     Soared further than clouds but fell not,     Based on hills that shook not nor melted     With that burden enormous, hardly to be believed       Rent with stupendous chasms,     Full of an umber twilight,     I beheld that larger world      Bright was the twilight, sharp like ethereal wine     Above, but low in the clefts it thickened,     Dull as with duskier tincture      Like whimsical wings outspread but unstirring,     Flowers that seemed spirits of the twilight     That must pass with its passing—     Too fragile for day or for darkness,     Fed the dusk with more delicate hues than its own      Stars that were nearer, more radiant than ours,     Quivered and pulsed in the clear thin gold of the sky       These things I beheld     Till the gold was shaken with flight     Of fantastical wings like broken shadows,     Forerunning the darkness      Till the twilight shivered with outcry of eldritch voices     Like pain’s last cry ere oblivion             I bring my weariness to thee,     My bitter dreams I bring      Love with a wounded wing,     And life consumed of memory,     I bring to thee       The haven of thy happy breast—     Of this my dreams are fain:     For all my weary pain,     In all the world there is no rest,     But on thy breast             There is no peace amid the moonlight and the pines      Deep in the windless gloom the lamplike thought of you     Abides  and ah, what burning memories pursue     My heart among the pallid marbles!*** Night assigns      Your silver face for wardress of the doors of Sleep      Beyond the wild, last bourn of dreamland, lo, your eyes     Are on the lonesome, ultimate, undiscovered skies      Moonlike and dim, you wander ever in the deep      Which is the secret, innermost, unknown abyss     Of my own soul, and in its night your spirit lives ****     Shall I not find the very draught that Lethe gives,     Sweet with your tears, and warm with savour of your kiss?              Our passion is a secret Paradise—     Eden of lotos and the fruitful date,     With silence walled and held undesecrate     By man or prying seraph: We are wise      As any god and goddess, who have wrung     From roseal fruitage of a bough forbidden,     The happy wine we drink, we drink unchidden,     Deep in the vales where vernal leaves are young,      And the first poppies loiter **** Though the breath     Of all the gods a bolted storm prepare,     And blood-red gloom of thunders blind the sun,      Shall we not turn, with clinging kisses there,     And, laughing, quaff some dreamless wine of death—     Triumphant still, in mere oblivion?            Thy beauty is the warmth and languor and passion of a tropic autumn,     Caressing all the senses,—     With light from skies of heavy azure,     With perfume from hidden orchids many-hued     That burn in the berylline dusk of palms      With the balmy kiss of tropic wind and wave,     And the songs of exotic birds that pass     In vermilion-flashing flight from isle to isle on a cobalt sea ***     O, sweetness in the inmost sense,     As of golden fruits that have grown by the waters of Lethe,     Or fragrance of purple lilies, crushed by the limbs of lovers,     In the shadow of a wood of cypress!***     Thou pervadest me with thy love,     As the dawn pervadeth a valley among mountains,     Or as opaline sunset filleth the amaranth-coloured sea      The desire of thy heart is upon me,     As a myrtle-scented wind from the isle of Cythera,     Where Aphrodite waits for Adonis,     Lying naked among the flag lilies by a pool of chrysolite      I inhale thy love     As the breath of hidden gardens of purple and scarlet,     Where Circe wanders,     Clad in a trailing gown whose colours are the gold of flame,     And the azure of the skies of autumn             Blind with your softly fallen hair,     I turn me from the twilight air      And, ah, the wordless tale of love     My lips upon your lips declare!      High stars are on the shadowy south—     Unseen, unknown: The urgent drouth     Of desert years in one deep kiss,     Would drain the sweetness of your mouth       Our straining arms that clasp and close,     Ache with an ecstasy that grows      And passion in our secret veins,     Like burning amber, glows and glows       This love is sweet to have and hold,     Better than sandalwood or gold,     After the barren, bitter loves,     The mad and mournful loves of old       This love is fortunate and fair,     Behind its veil of fallen hair      This love hath soft and clinging arms,     And a kind bosom, warm and bare             As the fumes of myrrh that mix with the odour of sandalwood     In a temple sacred to the goddess Lakme      As moonlight mingled with starlight     In the lucent azure of an autumn lake      As the sunset-rays of gold and crimson     That interlace on a couch of purple cloud—     Even so, Beloved,     Hath my love mingled with thine—     Even so, our souls are one,     Like two winds that meet in a valley of rose and lotus,     And fall to rest, uniting     As the still and fragrant air that lingers     On a bed of falling petals             My beloved is a well of clear waters,     To which I have come at noontide,     From the land of the Abomination of Desolation,     From the lion-dreaded waste,     Where nothing dwelleth but the inconsolable crying of an evil wind,     And the wandering realms and cities of the wide mirage      Where no one passeth except the sun,     Who walked like a terrible god through the hell of the brazen skies      And the dreadful cohorts of the constellations,     Who pass remote in alien years,     And clad with icy azures of unattainable distance       My beloved is a singing fountain,     Set in a wide oasis,     Between the frondage of the fruitful palm,     And the branches of the flowering myrtle:     The wind that bloweth thereon,     Hath lain in a vale of cassia and myrrh,     And caressed the vermilion blossoms of the pomegranate,     Whose red is the red of the lips of Astarte      A thousand nightingales are gathered there,     From all the gardens of lost romance      And plots of purple and silver lillies,     More beautiful than the meadows of mirage,     Revive the flowers of Sabean queens,     And the blossoms worn by all the princesses of legend ***     Ah, suffer me to dwell     Thereby, and forget the gilded cities of desire,     The domes of spectral gold,     That fled from horizon to horizon     Before me, and left my feet in the sinking vales and shifting         plains of the desert,     Whose waters are green with corruption,     And bitter with the dust and ashes of death      Ah, suffer me to sleep     In the balsam-laden shadows of the palm and myrtle,     By the ever-springing fountain!             With autumn and the flaring leaves our love must end—     Ere flauntful spring shall mock thy tears and my despair     With blossoms red or pale, some April bride may wear:     Now, while the weary, grey, forgetful heavens bend      Above the grief and languor of the dying lands,     In one last kiss shall meet and mingle and expire     The muted, last, remembering sighs of our desire      And on my face the flower-like burden of thy hands      Shall rest a little, and be taken tenderly,     And, ah, how lightly hence! And in thy golden eyes,     Thy love, and all the ashen glory of the skies,     Shall mingle, and as in a mirror lie for me             No more of gold and marble, nor of snow,     And sunlight, and vermilion, would I make     My vision and my symbols, nor would take     The auroral flame of some prismatic floe,     Nor iris of the frail and lunar bow,     Flung on the shafted waterfalls that wake     The night’s blue slumber in a shadowy lake ***     To body forth my fantasies, and show     Communicable mystery, I would find,     In adamantine darkness of the earth,     Metals untouched of any sun  and bring     Black azures of the nether sea to birth—     Or fetch the secret, splendid leaves, and blind,     Blue lilies of an Atlantean spring        Bow down: I am the emperor of dreams      I crown me with the million-coloured sun     Of secret worlds incredible, and take     Their trailing skies for vestment, when I soar,     Throned on the mounting zenith, and illume     The spaceward-flown horizons infinite      Like rampant monsters roaring for their glut,     The fiery-crested oceans rise and rise,     By jealous moons maleficently urged     To follow me forever  mountains horned     With peaks of sharpest adamant, and mawed     With sulphur-lit volcanoes lava-langued,     Usurp the skies with thunder, but in vain      And continents of serpent-shapen trees,     With slimy trunks that lengthen league by league,     Pursue my flight through ages spurned to fire     By that supreme ascendance  Sorcerers     And evil kings predominantly armed     With scrolls of fulvous dragon-skin, whereon     Are worm-like runes of ever-twisting flame,     Would stay me  and the sirens of the stars,     With foam-light songs from silver fragrance wrought,     Would lure me to their crystal reefs  and moons     Where viper-eyed, senescent devils dwell,     With antic gnomes abominably wise,     Heave up their icy horns across my way:     But naught deters me from the goal ordained     By suns, and aeons, and immortal wars,     And sung by moons and motes  the goal whose name     Is all the secret of forgotten glyphs,     By sinful gods in torrid rubies writ     For ending of a brazen book  the goal     Whereat my soaring ecstacy may stand,     In amplest heavens multiplied to hold     My hordes of thunder-vested avatars,     And Promethèan armies of my thought,     That brandish claspèd levins  There I call     My memories, intolerably clad     In light the peaks of paradise may wear,     And lead the Armageddon of my dreams,     Whose instant shout of triumph is become     Immensity’s own music: For their feet     Are founded on innumerable worlds,     Remote in alien epochs, and their arms     Upraised, are columns potent to exalt     With ease ineffable the countless thrones     Of all the gods that are and gods to be,     Or bear the seats of Asmadai and Set     Above the seventh paradise                                   Supreme     In culminant omniscience manifold,     And served by senses multitudinous,     Far-posted on the shifting walls of time,     With eyes that roam the star-unwinnowed fields     Of utter night and chaos, I convoke     The Babel of their visions, and attend     At once their myriad witness: I behold,     In Ombos, where the fallen Titans dwell,     With mountain-builded walls, and gulfs for moat,     The secret cleft that cunning dwarves have dug     Beneath an alp-like buttress  and I list,     Too late, the clang of adamantine gongs,     Dinned by their drowsy guardians, whose feet     Have felt the wasp-like sting of little knives,     Embrued with slobber of the basilisk,     Or juice of wounded upas  And I see,     In gardens of a crimson-litten world     The sacred flow’r with lips of purple flesh,     And silver-lashed, vermilion-lidded eyes     Of torpid azure  whom his furtive priests     At moonless eve in terror seek to slay,     With bubbling grails of sacrificial blood     That hide a hueless poison  And I read,     Upon the tongue of a forgotten sphinx,     The annuling word a spiteful demon wrote     With gall of slain chimeras  and I know     What pentacles the lunar wizards use,     That once allured the gulf-returning roc,     With ten great wings of furlèd storm, to pause     Midmost an alabaster mount  and there,     With boulder-weighted webs of dragons’-gut,     Uplift by cranes a captive giant built,     They wound the monstrous, moonquake-throbbing bird,     And plucked, from off his sabre-taloned feet,     Uranian sapphires fast in frozen blood,     With amethysts from Mars  I lean to read,     With slant-lipped mages, in an evil star,     The monstrous archives of a war that ran     Through wasted aeons, and the prophecy     Of wars renewed, that shall commemorate     Some enmity of wivern-headed kings,     Even to the brink of time  I know the blooms     Of bluish fungus, freaked with mercury,     That bloat within the craters of the moon,     And in one still, selenic hour have shrunk     To pools of slime and fetor  and I know     What clammy blossoms, blanched and cavern-grown,     Are proffered in Uranus to their gods     By mole-eyed peoples  and the livid seed     Of some black fruit a king in Saturn ate,     Which, cast upon his tinkling palace-floor,     Took root between the burnished flags, and now     Hath mounted, and become a hellish tree,     Whose lithe and hairy branches, lined with mouths,     Net like a hundred ropes his lurching throne,     And strain at starting pillars  I behold     The slowly-thronging corals, that usurp     Some harbour of a million-masted sea,     And sun them on the league-long wharves of gold—     Bulks of enormous crimson, kraken-limbed     And kraken-headed, lifting up as crowns     The octiremes of perished emperors,     And galleys fraught with royal gems, that sailed     From a sea-deserted haven                                  Swifter grow     The visions: Now a mighty city looms,     Hewn from a hill of purest cinnabar,     To domes and turrets like a sunrise thronged     With tier on tier of captive moons, half-drowned     In shifting erubescence  But whose hands     Were sculptors of its doors, and columns wrought     To semblance of prodigious blooms of old,     No eremite hath lingered there to say,     And no man comes to learn: For long ago     A prophet came, warning its timid king     Against the plague of lichens that had crept     Across subverted empires, and the sand     Of wastes that Cyclopean mountains ward      Which, slow and ineluctable, would come,     To take his fiery bastions and his fanes,     And quench his domes with greenish tetter  Now     I see a host of naked giants, armed     With horns of behemoth and unicorn,     Who wander, blinded by the clinging spells     Of hostile wizardry, and stagger on     To forests where the very leaves have eyes,     And ebonies like wrathful dragons roar     To teaks a-chuckle in the loathly gloom      Where coiled lianas lean, with serried fangs,     From writhing palms with swollen boles that moan      Where leeches of a scarlet moss have sucked     The eyes of some dead monster, and have crawled     To bask upon his azure-spotted spine      Where hydra-throated blossoms hiss and sing,     Or yawn with mouths that drip a sluggish dew,     Whose touch is death and slow corrosion  Then,     I watch a war of pigmies, met by night,     With pitter of their drums of parrot’s hide,     On plains with no horizon, where a god     Might lose his way for centuries  and there,     In wreathèd light, and fulgors all convolved,     A rout of green, enormous moons ascend,     With rays that like a shivering venom run     On inch-long swords of lizard-fang                                      Surveyed     From this my throne, as from a central sun,     The pageantries of worlds and cycles pass      Forgotten splendours, dream by dream unfold,     Like tapestry, and vanish  violet suns,     Or suns of changeful iridescence, bring     Their rays about me, like the coloured lights     Imploring priests might lift to glorify     The face of some averted god  the songs     Of mystic poets in a purple world,     Ascend to me in music that is made     From unconceivèd perfumes, and the pulse     Of love ineffable  the lute-players     Whose lutes are strung with gold of the utmost moon,     Call forth delicious languors, never known     Save to their golden kings  the sorcerers     Of hooded stars inscrutable to God,     Surrender me their demon-wrested scrolls,     Inscribed with lore of monstrous alchemies,     And awful transformations *** If I will,     I am at once the vision and the seer,     And mingle with my ever-streaming pomps,     And still abide their suzerain: I am     The neophyte who serves a nameless god,     Within whose fane the fanes of Hecatompylos     Were arks the Titan worshippers might bear,     Or flags to pave the threshold  or I am     The god himself, who calls the fleeing clouds     Into the nave where suns might congregate,     And veils the darkling mountain of his face     With fold on solemn fold  for whom the priests     Amass their monthly hecatomb of gems—     Opals that are a camel-cumbering load,     And monstrous alabraundines, won from war     With realms of hostile serpents  which arise,     Combustible, in vapours many-hued,     And myrrh-excelling perfumes  It is I,     The king, who holds with scepter-dropping hand     The helm of some great barge of chrysolite,     Sailing upon an amethystine sea     To isles of timeless summer: For the snows     Of hyperborean winter, and their winds,     Sleep in his jewel-builded capital,     Nor any charm of flame-wrought wizardry,     Nor conjured suns may rout them  so he flees,     With captive kings to urge his serried oars,     Hopeful of dales where amaranthine dawn     Hath never left the faintly sighing lote     And fields of lisping moly  Or I fare,     Impanoplied with azure diamond,     As hero of a quest Achernar lights,     To deserts filled with ever-wandering flames,     That feed upon the sullen marl, and soar     To wrap the slopes of mountains, and to leap,     With tongues intolerably lengthening,     That lick the blenchèd heavens  But there lives     (Secure as in a garden walled from wind)     A lonely flower by a placid well,     Midmost the flaring tumult of the flames,     That roar as roars the storm-possessèd sea,     Implacable forever: And within     That simple grail the blossom lifts, there lies     One drop of an incomparable dew,     Which heals the parchèd weariness of kings,     And cures the wound of wisdom  I am page     To an emperor who reigns ten thousand years,     And through his labyrinthine palace-rooms,     Through courts and colonnades and balconies     Wherein immensity itself is mazed,     I seek the golden gorget he hath lost,     On which the names of his conniving stars     Are writ in little sapphires  and I roam     For centuries, and hear the brazen clocks     Innumerably clang with such a sound     As brazen hammers make, by devils dinned     On tombs of all the dead  and nevermore     I find the gorget, but at length I find     A sealèd room whose nameless prisoner     Moans with a nameless torture, and would turn     To hell’s red rack as to a lilied couch     From that whereon they stretched him  and I find,     Prostrate upon a lotus-painted floor,     The loveliest of all beloved slaves     My emperor hath, and from her pulseless side     A serpent rises, whiter than the root     Of some venefic bloom in darkness grown,     And gazes up with green-lit eyes that seem     Like drops of cold, congealing poison ***                                  Hark!     What word was whispered in a tongue unknown,     In crypts of some impenetrable world?     Whose is the dark, dethroning secrecy     I cannot share, though I am king of suns     And king therewith of strong eternity,     Whose gnomons with their swords of shadow guard     My gates, and slay the intruder? Silence loads     The wind of ether, and the worlds are still     To hear the word that flees me  All my dreams     Fall like a rack of fuming vapours raised     To semblance by a necromant, and leave     Spirit and sense unthinkably alone,     Above a universe of shrouded stars,     And suns that wander, cowled with sullen gloom,     Like witches to a Sabbath *** Fear is born     In crypts below the nadir, and hath crawled     Reaching the floor of space and waits for wings     To lift it upward, like a hellish worm     Fain for the flesh of seraphs  Eyes that gleam,     But are not eyes of suns or galaxies,     Gather and throng to the base of darkness  flame     Behind some black, abysmal curtain burns,     Implacable, and fanned to whitest wrath     By raisèd wings that flail the whiffled gloom,     And make a brief and broken wind that moans,     As one who rides a throbbing rack  There is     A Thing that crouches, worlds and years remote,     Whose horns a demon sharpens, rasping forth     A note to shatter the donjon-keeps of time,     And crack the sphere of crystal *** All is dark     For ages, and my tolling heart suspends     Its clamour, as within the clutch of death,     Tightening with tense, hermetic rigours  Then,     In one enormous, million-flashing flame,     The stars unveil, the suns remove their cowls,     And beam to their responding planets  time     Is mine once more, and armies of its dreams     Rally to that insuperable throne,     Firmed on the central zenith                                 Now I seek     The meads of shining moly I had found     In some remoter vision, by a stream     No cloud hath ever tarnished  where the sun,     A gold Narcissus, loiters evermore     Above his golden image: But I find     A corpse the ebbing water will not keep,     With eyes like sapphires that have lain in hell,     And felt the hissing embers  and the flow’rs     About me turn to hooded serpents, swayed     By flutes of devils in a hellish dance,     Meet for the nod of Satan, when he reigns     Above the raging Sabbath, and is wooed     By sarabands of witches  But I turn     To mountains guarding with their horns of snow     The source of that befoulèd rill, and seek     A pinnacle where none but eagles climb,     And they with failing pennons  But in vain     I flee, for on that pylon of the sky,     Some curse hath turned the unprinted snow to flame—     Red fires that curl and cluster to my tread,     Trying the summit’s narrow cirque  And now,     I see a silver python far beneath—     Vast as a river that a fiend hath witched,     And forced to flow remèant in its course     To fountains whence it issued  Rapidly     It winds from slope to crumbling slope, and fills     Ravines and chasmal gorges, till the crags     Totter with coil on coil incumbent  Soon     It hath entwined the pinnacle I keep,     And gapes with a fanged, unfathomable maw,     Wherein great Typhon, and Enceladus,     Were orts of daily glut  But I am gone,     For at my call a hippogriff hath come,     And firm between his thunder-beating wings,     I mount the sheer cerulean walls of noon,     And see the earth, a spurnèd pebble, fall     Lost in the fields of nether stars—and seek     A planet where the outwearied wings of time     Might pause and furl for respite, or the plumes     Of death be stayed, and loiter in reprieve     Above some deathless lily: For therein,     Beauty hath found an avatar of flow’rs—     Blossoms that clothe it as a coloured flame,     From peak to peak, from pole to sullen pole,     And turn the skies to perfume  There I find     A lonely castle, calm and unbeset,     Save by the purple spears of amaranth,     And tender-sworded iris  Walls upbuilt     Of flushèd marble, wonderful with rose,     And domes like golden bubbles, and minarets     That take the clouds as coronal—these are mine,     For voiceless looms the peaceful barbican,     And the heavy-teethed portcullis hangs aloft     As if to smile a welcome  So I leave     My hippogriff to crop the magic meads,     And pass into a court the lilies hold,     And tread them to a fragrance that pursues     To win the portico, whose columns, carved     Of lazuli and amber, mock the palms     Of bright, Aidennic forests—capitalled     With fronds of stone fretted to airy lace,     Enfolding drupes that seem as tawny clusters     Of breasts of unknown houris  and convolved     With vines of shut and shadowy-leavèd flow’rs,     Like the dropt lids of women that endure     Some loin-dissolving rapture  Through a door     Enlaid with lilies twined luxuriously,     I enter, dazed and blinded with the sun,     And hear, in gloom that changing colours cloud,     A chuckle sharp as crepitating ice,     Upheaved and cloven by shoulders of the damned     Who strive in Antenora  When my eyes     Undazzle, and the cloud of colour fades,     I find me in a monster-guarded room,     Where marble apes with wings of griffins crowd     On walls an evil sculptor wrought, and beasts     Wherein the sloth and vampire-bat unite,     Pendulous by their toes of tarnished bronze,     Usurp the shadowy interval of lamps     That hang from ebon arches  Like a ripple,     Borne by the wind from pool to sluggish pool     In fields where wide Cocytus flows his bound,     A crackling smile around that circle runs,     And all the stone-wrought gibbons stare at me     With eyes that turn to glowing coals  A fear     That found no name in Babel, flings me on,     Breathless and faint with horror, to a hall     Within whose weary, self-reverting round,     The languid curtains, heavier than palls,     Unnumerably depict a weary king,     Who fain would cool his jewel-crusted hands     In lakes of emerald evening, or the fields     Of dreamless poppies pure with rain  I flee     Onward, and all the shadowy curtains shake     With tremors of a silken-sighing mirth,     And whispers of the innumerable king,     Breathing a tale of ancient pestilence,     Whose very words are vile contagion  Then     I reach a room where caryatids,     Carved in the form of tall, voluptuous Titan women,     Surround a throne of flowering ebony     Where creeps a vine of crystal  On the throne,     There lolls a wan, enormous Worm, whose bulk,     Tumid with all the rottenness of kings,     O’erflows its arms with fold on creasèd fold     Of fat obscenely bloating  Open-mouthed     He leans, and from his throat a score of tongues,     Depending like to wreaths of torpid vipers,     Drivel with phosphorescent slime, that runs     Down all his length of soft and monstrous folds,     And creeping among the flow’rs of ebony,     Lends them the life of tiny serpents  Now,     Ere the Horror ope those red and lashless slits     Of eyes that draw the gnat and midge, I turn,     And follow down a dusty hall, whose gloom,     Lined by the statues with their mighty limbs,     Ends in a golden-roofed balcony     Sphering the flowered horizon                                  Ere my heart     Hath hushed the panic tumult of its pulses,     I listen, from beyond the horizon’s rim,     A mutter faint as when the far simoon,     Mounting from unknown deserts, opens forth,     Wide as the waste, those wings of torrid night     That fling the doom of cities from their folds,     And musters in its van a thousand winds,     That with disrooted palms for besoms, rise     And sweep the sands to fury  As the storm,     Approaching, mounts and loudens to the ears     Of them that toil in fields of sesame,     So grows the mutter, and a shadow creeps     Above the gold horizon, like a dawn     Of darkness climbing sunward  Now they come,     A Sabbath of abominable shapes,     Led by the fiends and lamiae of worlds     That owned my sway aforetime! Cockatrice,     Python, tragelaphus, leviathan,     Chimera, martichoras, behemoth,     Geryon and sphinx, and hydra, on my ken     Arise as might some Afrite-builded city,     Consummate in the lifting of a lash,     With thundrous domes and sounding obelisks,     And towers of night and fire alternate! Wings     Of white-hot stone along the hissing wind,     Bear up the huge and furnace-hearted beasts     Of hells beyond Rutilicus  and things     Whose lightless length would mete the gyre of moons—     Born from the caverns of a dying sun,     Uncoil to the very zenith, half disclosed     From gulfs below the horizon  octopi     Like blazing moons with countless arms of fire,     Climb from the seas of ever-surging flame     That roll and roar through planets unconsumed,     Beating on coasts of unknown metals  beasts     That range the mighty worlds of Alioth, rise,     Aforesting the heavens with multitudinous horns,     Within whose maze the winds are lost  and borne     On cliff-like brows of plunging scolopendras,     The shell-wrought tow’rs of ocean-witches loom,     And griffin-mounted gods, and demons throned     On sable dragons, and the cockodrills     That bear the spleenful pygmies on their backs      And blue-faced wizards from the worlds of Saiph,     On whom Titanic scorpions fawn  and armies     That move with fronts reverted from the foe,     And strike athwart their shoulders at the shapes     Their shields reflect in crystal  and eidola     Fashioned within unfathomable caves     By hands of eyeless peoples  and the blind     And worm-shaped monsters of a sunless world,     With krakens from the ultimate abyss,     And Demogorgons of the outer dark,     Arising, shout with multitudinous thunders,     And threatening me with dooms ineffable     In words whereat the heavens leap to flame,     Advance on the magic palace! Thrown before,     For league on league, their blasting shadows blight     And eat like fire the amaranthine meads,     Leaving an ashen desert! In the palace,     I hear the apes of marble shriek and howl      And all the women-shapen columns moan,     Babbling with unknown terror  In my fear,     A monstrous dread unnamed in any hell,     I rise, and flee with the fleeing wind for wings,     And in a trice the magic palace reels,     And spiring to a single tow’r of flame,     Goes out, and leaves nor shard nor ember! Flown     Beyond the world, upon that fleeing wind,     I reach the gulf’s irrespirable verge,     Where fails the strongest storm for breath and fall,     Supportless, through the nadir-plunged gloom,     Beyond the scope and vision of the sun,     To other skies and systems  In a world     Deep-wooded with the multi-coloured fungi,     That soar to semblance of fantastic palms,     I fall as falls the meteor-stone, and break     A score of trunks to powder  All unhurt,     I rise, and through the illimitable woods,     Among the trees of flimsy opal, roam,     And see their tops that clamber, hour by hour,     To touch the suns of iris  Things unseen,     Whose charnel breath informs the tideless air     With spreading pools of fetor, follow me     Elusive past the ever-changing palms      And pittering moths, with wide and ashen wings,     Flit on before, and insects ember-hued,     Descending, hurtle through the gorgeous gloom,     And quench themselves in crumbling thickets  Heard     Far-off, the gong-like roar of beasts unknown     Resounds at measured intervals of time,     Shaking the riper trees to dust, that falls     In clouds of acrid perfume, stifling me     Beneath a pall of iris                                Now the palms     Grow far apart and lessen momently     To shrubs a dwarf might topple  Over them     I see an empty desert, all ablaze     With amethysts and rubies, and the dust     Of garnets or carnelians  On I roam,     Treading the gorgeous grit, that dazzles me     With leaping waves of endless rutilance,     Whereby the air is turned to a crimson gloom,     Through which I wander, blind as any Kobold      Till underfoot the griding sands give place     To stone or metal, with a massive ring     More welcome to mine ears than golden bells,     Or tinkle of silver fountains  When the gloom     Of crimson lifts, I stand upon the edge     Of a broad black plain of adamant, that reaches,     Level as a windless water, to the verge     Of all the world  and through the sable plain,     A hundred streams of shattered marble run,     And streams of broken steel, and streams of bronze,     Like to the ruin of all the wars of time,     To plunge, with clangour of timeless cataracts,     Adown the gulfs eternal                                      So I follow,     Between a river of steel and a river of bronze,     With ripples loud and tuneless as the clash     Of a million lutes  and come to the precipice     From which they fall, and make the mighty sound     Of a million swords that meet a million shields,     Or din of spears and armour in the wars     Of all the worlds and aeons: Far beneath,     They fall, through gulfs and cycles of the void,     And vanish like a stream of broken stars,     Into the nether darkness  nor the gods     Of any sun, nor demons of the gulf,     Will dare to know what everlasting sea     Is fed thereby, and mounts forevermore     With mighty tides unebbing                                  Lo, what cloud,     Or night of sudden and supreme eclipse,     Is on the suns of opal? At my side,     The rivers rail with a wan and ghostly gleam,     Through darkness falling as the night that falls     From mighty spheres extinguished! Turning now,     I see, betwixt the desert and the suns,     The poised wings of all the dragon-rout,     Far-flown in black occlusion thousand-fold     Through stars, and deeps, and devastated worlds,     Upon my trail of terror! Griffins, rocs,     And sluggish, dark chimeras, heavy-winged     After the ravin of dispeopled lands,     With harpies, and the vulture-birds of hell—     Hot from abominable feasts and fain     To cool their beaks and talons in my blood—     All, all have gathered, and the wingless rear,     With rank on rank of foul, colossal Worms,     Like pillars of embattled night and flame,     Looms on the wide horizon! From the van,     I hear the shriek of wyvers, loud and shrill     As tempests in a broken fane, and roar     Of sphinxes, like the unrelenting toll     Of bells from tow’rs infernal  Cloud on cloud,     They arch the zenith, and a dreadful wind     Falls from them like the wind before the storm      And in the wind my cloven garment streams,     And flutters in the face of all the void,     Even as flows a flaffing spirit, lost     On the Pit’s undying tempest! Louder grows     The thunder of the streams of stone and bronze —     Redoubled with the roar of torrent wings,     Inseparably mingled  Scarce I keep     My footing, in the gulfward winds of fear,     And mighty thunders, beating to the void     In sea-like waves incessant  and would flee     With them, and prove the nadir-founded night     Where fall the streams of ruin  but when I reach     The verge, and seek through sun-defeating gloom,     To measure with my gaze the dread descent,     I see a tiny star within the depths—     A light that stays me, while the wings of doom     Convene their thickening thousands: For the star     Increases, taking to its hueless orb,     With all the speed of horror-changèd dreams     The light as of a million million moons      And floating up through gulfs and glooms eclipsed,     It grows and grows, a huge white eyeless Face,     That fills the void and fills the universe,     And bloats against the limits of the world     With lips of flame that open ****                O winds that pass uncomforted     Through all the peacefulness of spring,     And tell the trees your sorrowing,     That they must mourn till ye are fled!      Think ye the Tyrian distance holds     The crystal of unquestioned sleep?     That those forgetful purples keep     No veiled, contentious greens and golds?      Half with communicated grief,     Half that they are not free to pass     With you across the flickering grass,     Mourns each inclined bough and leaf       And I, with soul disquieted,     Shall find within the haunted spring     No peace, till your strange sorrowing     Is down the Tyrian distance fled             In the green and flowerless garden I have dreamt,     Lying beneath perennial moons apart,     Whose cypress-builded bowr’s     And ivy-plighted myrtles none shall part       In the funereal maze of larch and laurel,     Across white lawns, athwart the spectral mountains,     Seen through the sighing haze     Of all the high and moon-suspended fountains       With feet enshaded by the fruitless green     Of summer trees that bear no summer blossom      With wintry lusters laid     Upon the mounded marble of thy bosom,      Thou dost await, O mournful, enigmatic     Image of love-bewildered Artemis,     Whose tender lips too late,     Or all too soon, have sought the wounding kiss         ,           Love is not yours, love is not mine:     It is the tranquil twilight heaven     Through which our pauseless feet are driven     Into the vast and desert noon       Love is not mine, love is not yours:     It is a flying fire that passes,     Perishing on the blind morasses,     After the frail and perished moon                 In a lost land, that only dreams have known,     Where flaming suns walk naked and alone      Among horizons bright as molten brass,     And glowing heavens like furnaces of glass,     It rears, with dome and tower manifold,     Rich as a dawn of amarant and gold,     Or gorgeous as the Phoenix, born of fire,     And soaring from an opalescent pyre,     Sheer to the zenith  Like some anademe     Of Titan jewels turned to flame and dream,     The city crowns the far horizon-light,     Over the flowered meads of damassin ***     A desert isle of madreperl! wherein     The thurifer and opal-fruited palm,     And heaven-thronging minarets becalm     The seas of azure wind ****            She is large and matronly      And rather dirty,      A little sardonic-looking, as if domesticity had           driven her to it        Though what she does, except lay four eggs at           random in the garden once a year      And put up with her husband,      I don't know        She likes to eat        She hurries up, striding reared on long uncanny           legs,      When food is going       Oh yes, she can make haste when she likes        She snaps the soft bread from my hand in great           mouthfuls,      Opening her rather pretty wedge of an iron,           pristine face      Into an enormously wide-beaked mouth      Like sudden curved scissors,      And gulping at more than she can swallow, and           working her thick, soft tongue,      And having the bread hanging over her chin        O Mistress, Mistress,      Reptile mistress,      Your eye is very dark, very bright,      And it never softens      Although you watch        She knows,      She knows well enough to come for food,      Yet she sees me not       Her bright eye sees, but not me, not anything,      Sightful, sightless, seeing and visionless,      Reptile mistress        Taking bread in her curved, gaping, toothless           mouth,      She has no qualm when she catches my finger in           her steel overlapping gums,      But she hangs on, and my shout and my shrinking           are nothing to her,      She does not even know she is nipping me with           her curved beak       Snake-like she draws at my finger, while I drag           it in horror away        Mistress, reptile mistress,      You are almost too large, I am almost frightened       He is much smaller,      Dapper beside her,      And ridiculously small        Her laconic eye has an earthy, materialistic look,      His, poor darling, is almost fiery        His wimple, his blunt-prowed face,      His low forehead, his skinny neck, his long,           scaled, striving legs,      So striving, striving,      Are all more delicate than she,      And he has a cruel scar on his shell        Poor darling, biting at her feet,      Running beside her like a dog, biting her earthy,           splay feet,      Nipping her ankles,      Which she drags apathetic away, though without           retreating into her shell        Agelessly silent,      And with a grim, reptile determination,      Cold,  voiceless  age-after-age  behind him,           serpents' long obstinacy      Of horizontal persistence        Little old man      Scuffling beside her, bending down, catching his           opportunity,      Parting his steel-trap face, so suddenly, and           seizing her scaly ankle,      And hanging grimly on,      Letting go at last as she drags away,      And closing his steel-trap face        His steel-trap, stoic, ageless, handsome face       Alas, what a fool he looks in this scuffle        And how he feels it!       The lonely rambler, the stoic, dignified stalker      through chaos,      The immune, the animate,      Enveloped in isolation,      Forerunner       Now look at him!       Alas, the spear is through the side of his isolation       His adolescence saw him crucified into sex,      Doomed, in the long crucifixion of desire, to seek           his consummation beyond himself       Divided into passionate duality,      He, so finished and immune, now broken into           desirous fragmentariness,      Doomed to make an intolerable fool of himself      In his effort toward completion again        Poor little earthy house-inhabiting Osiris,      The mysterious bull tore him at adolescence into           pieces,      And he must struggle after reconstruction,           ignominiously        And so behold him following the tail      Of that mud-hovel of his slowly-rambling spouse,      Like some unhappy bull at the tail of a cow,      But with more than bovine, grim,  earth-dank           persistence,      Suddenly seizing the ugly ankle as she stretches           out to walk,      Roaming over the sods,      Or, if it happen to show, at her pointed, heavy tail      Beneath the low-dropping back-board of her shell        Their two shells like doomed boats bumping,      Hers huge, his small       Their   splay   feet   rambling   and   rowing   like           paddles,      And stumbling mixed up in one another,      In the race of love--      Two tortoises,      She huge, he small        She seems earthily apathetic,      And he has a reptile's awful persistence        I heard a woman pitying her, pitying the Mère           Tortue       While I, I pity Monsieur       "He pesters her and torments her," said the           woman       How much more is _he_ pestered and tormented,           say I        What can he do?      He is dumb, he is visionless,      Conceptionless        His black, sad-lidded eye sees but beholds not      As her earthen mound moves on,      But he catches the folds of vulnerable, leathery           skin,      Nail-studded, that shake beneath her shell,      And drags at these with his beak,      Drags and drags and bites,      While she pulls herself free, and rows her dull           mound along               Making his advances      He does not look at her, nor sniff at her,      No, not even sniff at her, his nose is blank        Only he senses the vulnerable folds of skin      That work beneath her while she sprawls along      In her ungainly pace,      Her folds of skin that work and row      Beneath  the   earth-soiled  hovel  in  which  she           moves        And so he strains beneath her housey walls      And catches her trouser-legs in his beak      Suddenly, or her skinny limb,      And strange and grimly drags at her      Like a dog,      Only agelessly silent, with a reptile's awful      persistency        Grim, gruesome gallantry, to which he is doomed       Dragged out of an eternity of silent isolation      And doomed to partiality, partial being,      Ache, and want of being,      Want,      Self-exposure, hard humiliation, need to add           himself on to her        Born to walk alone,      Forerunner,      Now suddenly distracted into this mazy           sidetrack,      This awkward, harrowing pursuit,      This grim necessity from within        Does she know      As she moves eternally slowly away?      Or is he driven against her with a bang, like a bird           flying in the dark against a window,      All knowledgeless?       The awful concussion,      And the still more awful need to persist, to follow,           follow, continue,      Driven,   after  aeons  of  pristine,   fore-god-like           singleness and oneness,      At the end of some mysterious, red-hot iron,      Driven away from himself into her tracks,      Forced to crash against her        Stiff, gallant, irascible, crook-legged reptile,      Little gentleman,      Sorry plight,      We ought to look the other way        Save that, having come with you so far,      We will go on to the end                                      J              I thought he was dumb,      I said he was dumb,      Yet I've heard him cry        First faint scream,      Out of life's unfathomable dawn,      Far off, so far, like a madness, under the horizon's           dawning rim,      Far, far off, far scream        Tortoise _in extremis_        Why were we crucified into sex?       Why were we not left rounded off, and finished           in ourselves,      As we began,      As he certainly began, so perfectly alone?       A far, was-it-audible scream,      Or did it sound on the plasm direct?       Worse than the cry of the new-born,      A scream,      A yell,      A shout,      A pæan,      A death-agony,      A birth-cry,      A submission,      All tiny, tiny, far away, reptile under the first      dawn        War-cry,  triumph,  acute-delight,  death-scream           reptilian,      Why was the veil torn?       The silken shriek of the soul's torn membrane?      The male soul's membrane      Torn with a shriek half music, half horror        Crucifixion        Male tortoise, cleaving behind the hovel-wall of           that dense female,      Mounted and tense, spread-eagle, out-reaching           out of the shell      In tortoise-nakedness,      Long neck, and long vulnerable limbs extruded,      spread-eagle over her house-roof,      And the deep, secret, all-penetrating tail curved           beneath her walls,      Reaching  and gripping  tense,  more  reaching           anguish in uttermost tension      Till suddenly, in the spasm of coition, tupping           like a jerking leap, and oh!      Opening its clenched face from his outstretched           neck      And giving that fragile yell, that scream,      Super-audible,      From his pink, cleft, old-man's mouth,      Giving up the ghost,      Or screaming in Pentecost, receiving the ghost        His scream, and his moment's subsidence,      The moment of eternal silence,      Yet unreleased, and after the moment, the      sudden, startling jerk of coition, and at once      The inexpressible faint yell--      And so on, till the last plasm of my body was           melted back      To the primeval rudiments of life, and the secret        So he tups, and screams      Time after time that frail, torn scream      After each jerk, the longish interval,      The tortoise eternity,      Agelong, reptilian persistence,      Heart-throb, slow heart-throb, persistent for the           next spasm        I remember, when I was a boy,      I heard the scream of a frog, which was caught           with his foot in the mouth of an up-starting           snake       I remember when I first heard bull-frogs break           into sound in the spring       I remember hearing a wild goose out of the throat           of night      Cry loudly, beyond the lake of waters       I remember the first time, out of a bush in the           darkness, a nightingale's piercing cries and           gurgles startled the depths of my soul       I remember the scream of a rabbit as I went           through a wood at midnight       I remember the heifer in her heat, blorting and           blorting through the hours, persistent and           irrepressible       I remember my first terror hearing the howl of           weird, amorous cats       I remember the scream of a terrified, injured           horse, the sheet-lightning      And running away from the sound of a woman in           labor, something like an owl whooing,      And listening inwardly to the first bleat of a           lamb,      The first wail of an infant,      And my mother singing to herself,      And the first tenor singing of the passionate           throat of a young collier, who has long since           drunk himself to death,      The first elements of foreign speech      On wild dark lips        And more than all these,      And less than all these,      This last,      Strange, faint coition yell      Of the male tortoise at extremity,      Tiny from under the very edge of the farthest           far-off horizon of life        The cross,      The wheel on which our silence first is broken,      Sex, which breaks up our integrity, our single           inviolability, our deep silence      Tearing a cry from us        Sex, which breaks us into voice, sets us calling           across the deeps, calling, calling for the           complement,      Singing, and calling, and singing again, being           answered, having found        Torn, to become whole again, after long seeking           for what is lost,      The same cry from the tortoise as from Christ,           the Osiris-cry of abandonment,      That which is whole, torn asunder,      That which is in part, finding its whole again           throughout the universe            I      I remember, I remember       The house where I was born,     The little window where the sun       Came peeping in at morn      He never came a wink too soon,       Nor brought too long a day,     But now, I often wish the night       Had borne my breath away!         I remember, I remember       The roses, red and white,     The vi'lets, and the lily-cups,       Those flowers made of light!     The lilacs where the robin built,       And where my brother set     The laburnum on his birthday,--       The tree is living yet!         I remember, I remember       Where I was used to swing,     And thought the air must rush as fresh       To swallows on the wing      My spirit flew in feathers then,       That is so heavy now,     And summer pools could hardly cool       The fever on my brow!         I remember, I remember       The fir trees dark and high      I used to think their slender tops       Were close against the sky:     It was a childish ignorance,       But now 'tis little joy     To know I'm farther off from heav'n       Than when I was a boy                                 T        _ _       Little Lamb, who made thee?

quoth he, yet bring it me,       My leathern belt likewise     In which I bear my trusty sword       When I do exercise       Now Mistress Gilpin, careful soul,       Had two stone bottles found,     To hold the liquor that she loved,       And keep it safe and sound       Each bottle had a curling ear,       Through which the belt he drew,     And hung a bottle on each side       To make his balance true       Then over all, that he might be       Equipp'd from top to toe,     His long red cloak well-brush'd and neat,       He manfully did throw       Now see him mounted once again       Upon his nimble steed,     Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,       With caution and good heed       But finding soon a smoother road       Beneath his well-shod feet,     The snorting beast began to trot,       Which gall'd him in his seat       So, Fair and softly! John he cried,       But John he cried in vain      That trot became a gallop soon,       In spite of curb and rein       So stooping down, as needs he must       Who cannot sit upright,     He grasp'd the mane with both his hands       And eke with all his might       His horse, who never in that sort       Had handled been before,     What thing upon his back had got       Did wonder more and more       Away went Gilpin neck or nought,       Away went hat and wig      He little dreamt, when he set out,       Of running such a rig       The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,       Like streamer long and gay,     Till, loop and button failing both,       At last it flew away       Then might all people well discern       The bottles he had slung      A bottle swinging at each side       As hath been said or sung       The dogs did bark, the children scream'd,       Up flew the windows all,     And every soul cried out, Well done!       As loud as he could bawl       Away went Gilpin--who but he?       His fame soon spread around,     He carries weight, he rides a race,       'Tis for a thousand pound       And still as fast as he drew near,       'Twas wonderful to view     How in a trice the turnpike-men       Their gates wide open threw       And now as he went bowing down       His reeking head full low,     The bottles twain behind his back       Were shatter'd at a blow       Down ran the wine into the road       Most piteous to be seen,     Which made his horse's flanks to smoke       As they had basted been       But still he seem'd to carry weight,       With leathern girdle braced,     For all might see the bottle-necks       Still dangling at his waist       Thus all through merry Islington       These gambols he did play,     And till he came unto the Wash       Of Edmonton so gay       And there he threw the Wash about       On both sides of the way,     Just like unto a trundling mop,       Or a wild-goose at play       At Edmonton his loving wife       From the balcòny spied     Her tender husband, wondering much       To see how he did ride       Stop, stop, John Gilpin!--Here's the house--       They all at once did cry,     The dinner waits, and we are tired        Said Gilpin--So am I!      But yet his horse was not a whit       Inclined to tarry there,     For why? his owner had a house       Full ten miles off, at Ware       So like an arrow swift he flew       Shot by an archer strong,     So did he fly--which brings me to       The middle of my song       Away went Gilpin, out of breath,       And sore against his will,     Till at his friend the Callender's       His horse at last stood still       The Callender, amazed to see       His neighbour in such trim,     Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,       And thus accosted him--      What news? what news? your tidings tell,       Tell me you must and shall--     Say, why bareheaded you are come,       Or why you come at all?      Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,       And loved a timely joke,     And thus unto the Callender       In merry guise he spoke--      I came because your horse would come        And if I well forbode,     My hat and wig will soon be here,       They are upon the road       The Callender, right glad to find       His friend in merry pin,     Return'd him not a single word,       But to the house went in       Whence straight he came with hat and wig,       A wig that flow'd behind,     A hat not much the worse for wear,       Each comely in its kind       He held them up, and in his turn       Thus show'd his ready wit,       My head is twice as big as yours,       They therefore needs must fit       But let me scrape the dirt away,       That hangs upon your face      And stop and eat, for well you may       Be in a hungry case       Said John--It is my wedding-day,       And all the world would stare,     If wife should dine at Edmonton       And I should dine at Ware       So, turning to his horse, he said,       I am in haste to dine,     'Twas for your pleasure you came here,       You shall go back for mine       Ah, luckless speech, and bootless boast!       For which he paid full dear,     For while he spake a braying ass       Did sing most loud and clear       Whereat his horse did snort as he       Had heard a lion roar,     And gallop'd off with all his might,       As he had done before       Away went Gilpin, and away       Went Gilpin's hat and wig      He lost them sooner than at first,       For why? they were too big       Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw       Her husband posting down     Into the country far away,       She pull'd out half-a-crown       And thus unto the youth she said,       That drove them to the Bell,     This shall be yours, when you bring back       My husband safe and well       The youth did ride, and soon did meet       John coming back amain,     Whom in a trice he tried to stop       By catching at his rein       But not performing what he meant,       And gladly would have done,     The frighten'd steed he frighten'd more       And made him faster run       Away went Gilpin, and away       Went postboy at his heels,     The postboy's horse right glad to miss       The lumbering of the wheels       Six gentlemen upon the road       Thus seeing Gilpin fly,     With postboy scampering in the rear,       They raised the hue and cry       Stop thief!--stop thief!--a highwayman!       Not one of them was mute,     And all and each that pass'd that way       Did join in the pursuit       And now the turnpike gates again       Flew open in short space,     The toll-men thinking as before       That Gilpin rode a race       And so he did and won it too,       For he got first to town,     Nor stopp'd till where he had got up       He did again get down       --Now let us sing, Long live the king,       And Gilpin long live he,     And when he next doth ride abroad,       May I be there to see!

He needs must think of her once more,       How in the grave she lies      And with his hard, rough hand he wipes       A tear out of his eyes       Toiling,--rejoicing,--sorrowing,       Onward through life he goes      Each morning sees some task begin,       Each evening sees it close      Something attempted, something done,       Has earned a night's repose       Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,       For the lesson thou hast taught!

One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,     When they reach'd the hall door  and the charger stood near      So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,     So light to the saddle before her he sprung!

At day-break, on the bleak sea-beach       A fisherman stood aghast,     To see the form of a maiden fair       Lashed close to a drifting mast       The salt sea was frozen on her breast,       The salt tears in her eyes      And he saw her hair like the brown sea-weed       On the billows fall and rise       Such was the wreck of the Hesperus,       In the midnight and the snow!

Oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we must '     In terror she spoke, letting sink her         Wings until they trailed in the dust--     In agony sobbed, letting sink her         Plumes till they trailed in the dust--     Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust   [Illustration]         I replied 'This is nothing but dreaming:         Let us on by this tremulous light          Let us bathe in this crystalline light:     Its sibyllic splendour is beaming         With hope and in beauty to-night:--         See!--it flickers up the sky through the night!     Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,         And be sure it will lead us aright--     We safely may trust to a gleaming         That cannot but guide us aright,         Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night '         Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,         And tempted her out of her gloom--         And conquered her scruples and gloom      And we passed to the end of a vista,         But were stopped by the door of a tomb--         By the door of a legended tomb      And I said, 'What is written, sweet sister,         On the door of this legended tomb?'         She replied:--'Ulalume--Ulalume--         'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!'         Then my heart it grew ashen and sober         As the leaves that were crisped and sere,         As the leaves that were withering and sere      And I cried--'It was surely October         On _this_ very night of last year,         That I journeyed--I journeyed down here--         That I brought a dread burden down here!

Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber--             This misty mid region of Weir--         Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,--             This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir '                                    E  A        _ _  A   A        In Xanadu did Kubla Khan     A stately pleasure-dome decree:     Where Alph, the sacred river, ran     Through caverns measureless to man         Down to a sunless sea      So twice five miles of fertile ground     With walls and towers were girdled round:     And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills     Where blossom'd many an incense-bearing tree      And here were forests ancient as the hills,     Enfolding sunny spots of greenery       But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted     Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!     A savage place! as holy and enchanted     As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted     By woman wailing for her demon-lover!     And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething     As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,     A mighty fountain momently was forced:     Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst     Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,     Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail      And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever     It flung up momently the sacred river      Five miles meandering with a mazy motion     Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,     Then reach'd the caverns measureless to man,     And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:     And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far     Ancestral voices prophesying war!

The woodbine creeps abroad   Calling low to her lover:     The sun-lit flirt who all the day     Has poised above her lips in play     And stolen kisses, shallow and gay     Of pollen, now has gone away     --She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,   And when above her his broad wings hover   Then her bright breast she will uncover   And yield her honey-drop to her lover     Into the yellow, evening glow   Saunters a man from the farm below,   Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed   Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed      The bird lies warm against the wall      She glances quick her startled eyes     Towards him, then she turns away     Her small head, making warm display     Of red upon the throat  His terrors sway     Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,     Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies     In one blue stoop from out the sties     Into the evening's empty hall   Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes Hide your quaint, unfading blushes, Still your quick tail, and lie as dead, Till the distance folds over his ominous tread   The rabbit presses back her ears, Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes And crouches low: then with wild spring Spurts from the terror of _his_ oncoming To be choked back, the wire ring Her frantic effort throttling:     Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!  Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies, And swings all loose to the swing of his walk  Yet calm and kindly are his eyes And ready to open in brown surprise Should I not answer to his talk Or should he my tears surmise   I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair Watching the door open: he flashes bare His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes In a smile like triumph upon me  then careless-wise He flings the rabbit soft on the table board And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad Blade of his hand that raise my face to applaud His coming: he raises up my face to him And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare! I know not what fine wire is round my throat, I only know I let him finger there My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood: And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown Within him, die, and find death good          Under the long, dark boughs, like jewels red       In the hair of an Eastern girl Shine strings of crimson cherries, as if had bled       Blood-drops beneath each curl   Under the glistening cherries, with folded wings       Three dead birds lie: Pale-breasted throstles and a blackbird, robberlings       Stained with red dye   Under the haystack a girl stands laughing at me,       With cherries hung round her ears-- Offering me her scarlet fruit: I will see       If she has any tears            I  Ah, you stack of white lilies, all white and gold, I am adrift as a sunbeam, and without form Or having, save I light on you to warm Your pallor into radiance, flush your cold  White beauty into incandescence: you Are not a stack of white lilies to-night, but a white And clustered star transfigured by me to-night, And lighting these ruddy leaves like a star dropped through  The slender bare arms of the branches, your tire-maidens Who lift swart arms to fend me off  but I come Like a wind of fire upon you, like to some Stray whitebeam who on you his fire unladens   And you are a glistening toadstool shining here Among the crumpled beech-leaves phosphorescent, My stack of white lilies burning incandescent Of me, a soft white star among the leaves, my dear      Is it with pain, my dear, that you shudder so? Is it because I have hurt you with pain, my dear?      Did I shiver?--Nay, truly I did not know--     A dewdrop may-be splashed on my face down here   Why even now you speak through close-shut teeth  I have been too much for you--Ah, I remember!      The ground is a little chilly underneath     The leaves--and, dear, you consume me all to an ember   You hold yourself all hard as if my kisses Hurt as I gave them--you put me away--      Ah never I put you away: yet each kiss hisses     Hot as a drop of fire wastes me away      I am ashamed, you wanted me not to-night-- Nay, it is always so, you sigh with me  Your radiance dims when I draw too near, and my free Fire enters your petals like death, you wilt dead white   Ah, I do know, and I am deep ashamed  You love me while I hover tenderly Like clinging sunbeams kissing you: but see When I close in fire upon you, and you are flamed  With the swiftest fire of my love, you are destroyed  'Tis a degradation deep to me, that my best Soul's whitest lightning which should bright attest God stepping down to earth in one white stride,  Means only to you a clogged, numb burden of flesh Heavy to bear, even heavy to uprear Again from earth, like lilies wilted and sere Flagged on the floor, that before stood up so fresh           And you remember, in the afternoon The sea and the sky went grey, as if there had sunk A flocculent dust on the floor of the world: the festoon Of the sky sagged dusty as spider cloth, And coldness clogged the sea, till it ceased to croon   A dank, sickening scent came up from the grime Of weed that blackened the shore, so that I recoiled Feeling the raw cold dun me: and all the time You leapt about on the slippery rocks, and threw The words that rang with a brassy, shallow chime   And all day long that raw and ancient cold Deadened me through, till the grey downs darkened to sleep  Then I longed for you with your mantle of love to fold Me over, and drive from out of my body the deep Cold that had sunk to my soul, and there kept hold   But still to me all evening long you were cold, And I was numb with a bitter, deathly ache  Till old days drew me back into their fold, And dim sheep crowded me warm with companionship, And old ghosts clustered me close, and sleep was cajoled   I slept till dawn at the window blew in like dust, Like the linty, raw-cold dust disturbed from the floor Of a disused room: a grey pale light like must That settled upon my face and hands till it seemed To flourish there, as pale mould blooms on a crust   Then I rose in fear, needing you fearfully, For I thought you were warm as a sudden jet of blood  I thought I could plunge in your spurting hotness, and be Clean of the cold and the must --With my hand on the latch I heard you in your sleep speak strangely to me   And I dared not enter, feeling suddenly dismayed  So I went and washed my deadened flesh in the sea And came back tingling clean, but worn and frayed With cold, like the shell of the moon: and strange it seems That my love has dawned in rose again, like the love of a maid         -   I  When shall I see the half moon sink again Behind the black sycamore at the end of the garden? When will the scent of the dim, white phlox Creep up the wall to me, and in at my open window?  Why is it, the long slow stroke of the midnight bell,     (Will it never finish the twelve?) Falls again and again on my heart with a heavy reproach?  The moon-mist is over the village, out of the mist speaks the bell, And all the little roofs of the village bow low, pitiful, beseeching, resigned:     Oh, little home, what is it I have not done well?  Ah home, suddenly I love you, As I hear the sharp clean trot of a pony down the road, Succeeding sharp little sounds dropping into the silence, Clear upon the long-drawn hoarseness of a train across the valley   The light has gone out from under my mother's door          That she should love me so,         She, so lonely, greying now,         And I leaving her,         Bent on my pursuits!      Love is the great Asker,     The sun and the rain do not ask the secret      Of the time when the grain struggles down in the dark      The moon walks her lonely way without anguish,     Because no loved one grieves over her departure      Forever, ever by my shoulder pitiful Love will linger, Crouching as little houses crouch under the mist when I turn  Forever, out of the mist the church lifts up her reproachful finger, Pointing my eyes in wretched defiance where love hides her face to mourn       Oh but the rain creeps down to wet the grain         That struggles alone in the dark,     And asking nothing, cheerfully steals back again!         The moon sets forth o' nights         To walk the lonely, dusky heights         Serenely, with steps unswerving          Pursued by no sigh of bereavement,         No tears of love unnerving         Her constant tread:     While ever at my side,         Frail and sad, with grey bowed head,         The beggar-woman, the yearning-eyed         Inexorable love goes lagging   The wild young heifer, glancing distraught, With a strange new knocking of life at her side     Runs seeking a loneliness  The little grain draws down the earth to hide  Nay, even the slumberous egg, as it labours under the shell,     Patiently to divide, and self-divide, Asks to be hidden, and wishes nothing to tell   But when I draw the scanty cloak of silence over my eyes, Piteous Love comes peering under the hood  Touches the clasp with trembling fingers, and tries To put her ear to the painful sob of my blood, While her tears soak through to my breast,       Where they burn and cauterise        The moon lies back and reddens    In the valley, a corncrake calls         Monotonously,   With a piteous, unalterable plaint, that deadens         My confident activity:   With a hoarse, insistent request that falls         Unweariedly, unweariedly,         Asking something more of me,             Yet more of me!            Do you remember How night after night swept level and low Overhead, at home, and had not one star, Nor one narrow gate for the moon to go     Forth to her field of November       And you remember, How towards the north a red blot on the sky Burns like a blotch of anxiety Over the forges, and small flames ply     Like ghosts the shadow of the ember       Those were the days When it was awful autumn to me, When only there glowed on the dark of the sky The red reflection of her agony,     My beloved smelting down in the blaze      Of death--my dearest Love who had borne, and was now leaving me  And I at the foot of her cross did suffer     My own gethsemane       So I came to you, And twice, after great kisses, I saw The rim of the moon divinely rise And strive to detach herself from the raw     Blackened edge of the skies       Strive to escape  With her whiteness revealing my sunken world Tall and loftily shadowed  But the moon Never magnolia-like unfurled     Her white, her lamp-like shape       For you told me no, And bade me not to ask for the dour Communion, offering--"a better thing " So I lay on your breast for an obscure hour     Feeling your fingers go      Like a rhythmic breeze Over my hair, and tracing my brows, Till I knew you not from a little wind: --I wonder now if God allows     Us only one moment his keys       If only then You could have unlocked the moon on the night, And I baptized myself in the light Of your love  we both have entered then the white     Pure passion, and never again       I wonder if only You had taken me then, how different Life would have been: should I have spent Myself in waste, and you have bent     Your pride, through being lonely?         The little river twittering in the twilight, The wan, wondering look of the pale sky,     This is almost bliss   And everything shut up and gone to sleep, All the troubles and anxieties and pain     Gone under the twilight   Only the twilight now, and the soft "Sh!" of the river     That will last for ever   And at last I know my love for you is here, I can see it all, it is whole like the twilight, It is large, so large, I could not see it before Because of the little lights and flickers and interruptions,     Troubles, anxieties and pains       You are the call and I am the answer,     You are the wish, and I the fulfilment,     You are the night, and I the day          What else--it is perfect enough,         It is perfectly complete,         You and I,         What more----? Strange, how we suffer in spite of this!        I felt the lurch and halt of her heart     Next my breast, where my own heart was beating  And I laughed to feel it plunge and bound, And strange in my blood-swept ears was the sound     Of the words I kept repeating, Repeating with tightened arms, and the hot blood's blindfold art   Her breath flew warm against my neck,     Warm as a flame in the close night air  And the sense of her clinging flesh was sweet Where her arms and my neck's blood-surge could meet      Holding her thus, did I care That the black night hid her from me, blotted out every speck?  I leaned me forward to find her lips,     And claim her utterly in a kiss, When the lightning flew across her face, And I saw her for the flaring space     Of a second, afraid of the clips Of my arms, inert with dread, wilted in fear of my kiss   A moment, like a wavering spark,     Her face lay there before my breast, Pale love lost in a snow of fear, And guarded by a glittering tear,     And lips apart with dumb cries  A moment, and she was taken again in the merciful dark   I heard the thunder, and felt the rain,     And my arms fell loose, and I was dumb  Almost I hated her, she was so good, Hated myself, and the place, and my blood,     Which burned with rage, as I bade her come Home, away home, ere the lightning floated forth again          When the autumn roses   Are heavy with dew, Before the mist discloses   The leaf's brown hue, You would, among the laughing hills   Of yesterday Walk innocent in the daffodils, Coiffing up your auburn hair In a puritan fillet, a chaste white snare To catch and keep me with you there   So far away   When from the autumn roses   Trickles the dew, When the blue mist uncloses   And the sun looks through, You from those startled hills   Come away, Out of the withering daffodils  Thoughtful, and half afraid, Plaiting a heavy, auburn braid And coiling it round the wise brows of a maid   Who was scared in her play   When in the autumn roses   Creeps a bee, And a trembling flower encloses   His ecstasy, You from your lonely walk   Turn away, And leaning to me like a flower on its stalk, Wait among the beeches For your late bee who beseeches To creep through your loosened hair till he reaches,   Your heart of dismay         Slowly the moon is rising out of the ruddy haze, Divesting herself of her golden shift, and so Emerging white and exquisite  and I in amaze See in the sky before me, a woman I did not know I loved, but there she goes and her beauty hurts my heart  I follow her down the night, begging her not to depart      A      High and smaller goes the moon, she is small and very far from me, Wistful and candid, watching me wistfully, and I see Trembling blue in her pallor a tear that surely I have seen before, A tear which I had hoped that even hell held not again in store      A     A tiny moon as white and small as a single jasmine flower Leans all alone above my window, on night's wintry bower, Liquid as lime-tree blossom, soft as brilliant water or rain She shines, the one white love of my youth, which all sin cannot stain       -   The train in running across the weald has fallen into a steadier stroke So even, it beats like silence, and sky and earth in one unbroke Embrace of darkness lie around, and crushed between them all the loose And littered lettering of leaves and hills and houses closed, and we can use The open book of landscape no more, for the covers of darkness have shut upon Its written pages, and sky and earth and all between are closed in one   And we are smothered between the darkness, we close our eyes and say "Hush!" we try To escape in sleep the terror of this immense deep darkness, and we lie Wrapped up for sleep  And then, dear God, from out of the twofold darkness, red As if from the womb the moon arises, as if the twin-walled darkness had bled In one great spasm of birth and given us this new, red moon-rise Which lies on the knees of the darkness bloody, and makes us hide our eyes   The train beats frantic in haste, and struggles away From this ruddy terror of birth that has slid down From out of the loins of night to flame our way With fear  but God, I am glad, so glad that I drown My terror with joy of confirmation, for now Lies God all red before me, and I am glad, As the Magi were when they saw the rosy brow Of the Infant bless their constant folly which had Brought them thither to God: for now I know That the Womb is a great red passion whence rises all The shapeliness that decks us here-below: Yea like the fire that boils within this ball Of earth, and quickens all herself with flowers, God burns within the stiffened clay of us  And every flash of thought that we and ours Send up to heaven, and every movement, does Fly like a spark from this God-fire of passion  And pain of birth, and joy of the begetting, And sweat of labour, and the meanest fashion Of fretting or of gladness, but the jetting Of a trail of the great fire against the sky Where we can see it, a jet from the innermost fire: And even in the watery shells that lie Alive within the cozy under-mire, A grain of this same fire I can descry   And then within the screaming birds that fly Across the lightning when the storm leaps higher  And then the swirling, flaming folk that try To come like fire-flames at their fierce desire, They are as earth's dread, spurting flames that ply Awhile and gush forth death and then expire  And though it be love's wet blue eyes that cry To hot love to relinquish its desire, Still in their depths I see the same red spark As rose to-night upon us from the dark         Now I am come again, you who have so desired My coming, why do you look away from me? Why does your cheek burn against me--have I inspired Such anger as sets your mouth unwontedly?  Ah, here I sit while you break the music beneath Your bow  for broken it is, and hurting to hear: Cease then from music--does anguish of absence bequeath Me only aloofness when I would draw near?         You, Helen, who see the stars As mistletoe berries burning in a black tree, You surely, seeing I am a bowl of kisses, Should put your mouth to mine and drink of me   Helen, you let my kisses steam Wasteful into the night's black nostrils  drink Me up I pray  oh you who are Night's Bacchante, How can you from my bowl of kisses shrink!        The last, silk-floating thought has gone from the dandelion stem, And the flesh of the stalk holds up for nothing a blank diadem   The night's flood-winds have lifted my last desire from me, And my hollow flesh stands up in the night abandonedly   As I stand on this hill, with the whitening cave of the city beyond, Helen, I am despoiled of my pride, and my soul turns fond:  Overhead the nightly heavens like an open, immense eye, Like a cat's distended pupil sparkles with sudden stars, As with thoughts that flash and crackle in uncouth malignancy They glitter at me, and I fear the fierce snapping of night's thought-stars   Beyond me, up the darkness, goes the gush of the lights of two towns, As the breath which rushes upwards from the nostrils of an immense Life crouched across the globe, ready, if need be, to pounce Across the space upon heaven's high hostile eminence   All round me, but far away, the night's twin consciousness roars With sounds that endlessly swell and sink like the storm of thought in the brain, Lifting and falling like slow breaths taken, pulsing like oars Immense that beat the blood of the night down its vein   The night is immense and awful, Helen, and I am insect small In the fur of this hill, clung on to the fur of shaggy, black heather  A palpitant speck in the fur of the night, and afraid of all, Seeing the world and the sky like creatures hostile together   And I in the fur of the world, and you a pale fleck from the sky, How we hate each other to-night, hate, you and I, As the world of activity hates the dream that goes on on high, As a man hates the dreaming woman he loves, but who will not reply      -         Is that the moon At the window so big and red? No one in the room, No one near the bed----?        Listen, her shoon Palpitating down the stair? --Or a beat of wings at the window there?        A moment ago She kissed me warm on the mouth, The very moon in the south Is warm with a bloody glow, The moon from far abysses Signalling those two kisses         And now the moon Goes slowly out of the west, And slowly back in my breast My kisses are sinking, soon       To leave me at rest         The trees rise tall and taller, lifted On a subtle rush of cool grey flame That issuing out of the dawn has sifted     The spirit from each leaf's frame   For the trailing, leisurely rapture of life Drifts dimly forward, easily hidden By bright leaves uttered aloud, and strife     Of shapes in the grey mist chidden   The grey, phosphorescent, pellucid advance Of the luminous purpose of God, shines out Where the lofty trees athwart stream chance     To shake flakes of its shadow about   The subtle, steady rush of the whole Grey foam-mist of advancing God, As He silently sweeps to His somewhere, his goal,     Is heard in the grass of the sod   Is heard in the windless whisper of leaves In the silent labours of men in the fields, In the downward dropping of flimsy sheaves     Of cloud the rain skies yield   In the tapping haste of a fallen leaf, In the flapping of red-roof smoke, and the small Foot-stepping tap of men beneath     These trees so huge and tall   For what can all sharp-rimmed substance but catch In a backward ripple, God's purpose, reveal For a moment His mighty direction, snatch     A spark beneath His wheel   Since God sweeps onward dim and vast, Creating the channelled vein of Man And Leaf for His passage, His shadow is cast     On all for us to scan   Ah listen, for Silence is not lonely: Imitate the magnificent trees That speak no word of their rapture, but only     Breathe largely the luminous breeze          A gang of labourers on the piled wet timber That shines blood-red beside the railway siding Seem to be making out of the blue of the morning Something faery and fine, the shuttles sliding,  The red-gold spools of their hands and faces shuttling Hither and thither across the morn's crystalline frame Of blue: trolls at the cave of ringing cerulean mining, And laughing with work, living their work like a game         I  =The Town=  Oh you stiff shapes, swift transformation seethes About you: only last night you were A Sodom smouldering in the dense, soiled air  To-day a thicket of sunshine with blue smoke-wreaths   To-morrow swimming in evening's vague, dim vapour Like a weeded city in shadow under the sea, Beneath an ocean of shimmering light you will be: Then a group of toadstools waiting the moon's white taper   And when I awake in the morning, after rain, To find the new houses a cluster of lilies glittering In scarlet, alive with the birds' bright twittering, I'll say your bond of ugliness is vain      =The Earth=  Oh Earth, you spinning clod of earth, And then you lamp, you lemon-coloured beauty  Oh Earth, you rotten apple rolling downward, Then brilliant Earth, from the burr of night in beauty As a jewel-brown horse-chestnut newly issued:-- You are all these, and strange, it is my duty To take you all, sordid or radiant tissued      =Men=  Oh labourers, oh shuttles across the blue frame of morning, You feet of the rainbow balancing the sky! Oh you who flash your arms like rockets to heaven, Who in lassitude lean as yachts on the sea-wind lie! You who in crowds are rhododendrons in blossom, Who stand alone in pride like lighted lamps  Who grappling down with work or hate or passion, Take strange lithe form of a beast that sweats and ramps: You who are twisted in grief like crumpled beech-leaves, Who curl in sleep like kittens, who kiss as a swarm Of clustered, vibrating bees  who fall to earth At last like a bean-pod: what are you, oh multiform?        We have bit no forbidden apple,     Eve and I, Yet the splashes of day and night Falling round us no longer dapple The same Eden with purple and white   This is our own still valley     Our Eden, our home, But day shows it vivid with feeling And the pallor of night does not tally With dark sleep that once covered its ceiling   My little red heifer, to-night I looked in her eyes,     --She will calve to-morrow: Last night when I went with the lantern, the sow was grabbing her litter With red, snarling jaws: and I heard the cries Of the new-born, and after that, the old owl, then the bats that flitter   And I woke to the sound of the wood-pigeons, and lay and listened,     Till I could borrow A few quick beats of a wood-pigeon's heart, and when I did rise The morning sun on the shaken iris glistened, And I saw that home, this valley, was wider than Paradise   I learned it all from my Eve     This warm, dumb wisdom  She's a finer instructress than years  She has taught my heart-strings to weave Through the web of all laughter and tears   And now I see the valley     Fleshed all like me With feelings that change and quiver: And all things seem to tally     With something in me, Something of which she's the giver      -   If she would come to me here,     Now the sunken swaths     Are glittering paths To the sun, and the swallows cut clear Into the low sun--if she came to me here!  If she would come to me now, Before the last mown harebells are dead, While that vetch clump yet burns red  Before all the bats have dropped from the bough Into the cool of night--if she came to me now!  The horses are untackled, the chattering machine Is still at last  If she would come, I would gather up the warm hay from The hill-brow, and lie in her lap till the green Sky ceased to quiver, and lost its tired sheen   I should like to drop On the hay, with my head on her knee And lie stone still, while she Breathed quiet above me--we could stop Till the stars came out to see   I should like to lie still As if I was dead--but feeling Her hand go stealing Over my face and my hair until This ache was shed      -   God shook thy roundness in His finger's cup, He sunk His hands in firmness down thy sides, And drew the circle of His grasp, O Man, Along thy limbs delighted, thine, His bride's   And so thou wert God-shapen: His finger Curved thy mouth for thee, and His strong shoulder Planted thee upright: art not proud to see In the curve of thine exquisite form the joy of the Moulder?  He took a handful of light and rolled a ball, Compressed it till its beam grew wondrous dark, Then gave thee thy dark eyes, O Man, that all He made had doorway to thee through that spark   God, lonely, put down His mouth in a kiss of creation, He kissed thee, O Man, in a passion of love, and left The vivid life of His love in thy mouth and thy nostrils  Keep then the kiss from the adultress' theft         Sister, tha knows while we was on the planks   Aside o' th' grave, while th' coffin wor lyin' yet On th' yaller clay, an' th' white flowers top of it   Tryin' to keep off 'n him a bit o' th' wet,  An' parson makin' haste, an' a' the black   Huddlin' close together a cause o' th' rain, Did t' 'appen ter notice a bit of a lass away back   By a head-stun, sobbin' an' sobbin' again?      --How should I be lookin' round       An' me standin' on the plank     Beside the open ground,       Where our Ted 'ud soon be sank?

Eh man, what a stubborn jackass thou art, Kiss me then--there!--ne'er mind if I scraight--I wor fond o' thee, Sweetheart      A 'S    Somebody's knocking at the door     Mother, come down and see  --I's think it's nobbut a beggar,     Say, I'm busy   Its not a beggar, mother,--hark     How hard he knocks     --Eh, tha'rt a mard-'arsed kid,     'E'll gi'e thee socks!

Eh, what a shame it seems As some should ha'e hardly a smite o' trouble     An' others has reams   It's a shame as 'e should be knocked about     Like this, I'm sure it is!

The snow is witherin' off'n th' gress An' a thick mist sucks at the clots o' snow, An' the moon above in a weddin' dress Goes fogged an' slow--     Love, should I tell thee summat?

The thick snow is crumpled on the roof, it plunges down Awfully  Must I call back those hundred eyes?--A voice Wakes from the hum, faltering about a noun-- My question! My God, I must break from this hoarse silence  That rustles beyond the stars to me --There, I have startled a hundred eyes, and I must look Them an answer back  It is more than I can bear   The snow descends as if the dull sky shook In flakes of shadow down  and through the gap Between the ruddy schools sweeps one black rook   The rough snowball in the playground stands huge and still With fair flakes settling down on it --Beyond, the town Is lost in the shadowed silence the skies distil   And all things are possessed by silence, and they can brood Wrapped up in the sky's dim space of hoarse silence Earnestly--and oh for me this class is a bitter rood      =The Best of School=    The blinds are drawn because of the sun,   And the boys and the room in a colourless gloom   Of under-water float: bright ripples run   Across the walls as the blinds are blown   To let the sunlight in  and I,   As I sit on the beach of the class alone,   Watch the boys in their summer blouses,   As they write, their round heads busily bowed:   And one after another rouses   And lifts his face and looks at me,   And my eyes meet his very quietly,   Then he turns again to his work, with glee     With glee he turns, with a little glad   Ecstasy of work he turns from me,   An ecstasy surely sweet to be had    And very sweet while the sunlight waves   In the fresh of the morning, it is to be   A teacher of these young boys, my slaves   Only as swallows are slaves to the eaves   They build upon, as mice are slaves   To the man who threshes and sows the sheaves                     Oh, sweet it is   To feel the lads' looks light on me,   Then back in a swift, bright flutter to work,   As birds who are stealing turn and flee     Touch after touch I feel on me   As their eyes glance at me for the grain   Of rigour they taste delightedly                         And all the class,   As tendrils reached out yearningly   Slowly rotate till they touch the tree   That they cleave unto, that they leap along   Up to their lives--so they to me     So do they cleave and cling to me,   So I lead them up, so do they twine   Me up, caress and clothe with free   Fine foliage of lives this life of mine    The lowest stem of this life of mine,   The old hard stem of my life   That bears aloft towards rarer skies   My top of life, that buds on high   Amid the high wind's enterprise    They all do clothe my ungrowing life   With a rich, a thrilled young clasp of life    A clutch of attachment, like parenthood,   Mounts up to my heart, and I find it good   And I lift my head upon the troubled tangled world, and though the pain Of living my life were doubled, I still have this to comfort and sustain, I have such swarming sense of lives at the base of me, such sense of lives Clustering upon me, reaching up, as each after the other strives To follow my life aloft to the fine wild air of life and the storm of thought, And though I scarcely see the boys, or know that they are there, distraught As I am with living my life in earnestness, still progressively and alone, Though they cling, forgotten the most part, not companions, scarcely known To me--yet still because of the sense of their closeness clinging densely to me, And slowly fingering up my stem and following all tinily The way that I have gone and now am leading, they are dear to me     They keep me assured, and when my soul feels lonely,   All mistrustful of thrusting its shoots where only   I alone am living, then it keeps   Me comforted to feel the warmth that creeps   Up dimly from their striving  it heartens my strife:   And when my heart is chill with loneliness,   Then comforts it the creeping tenderness   Of all the strays of life that climb my life      =Afternoon in School=      When will the bell ring, and end this weariness? How long have they tugged the leash, and strained apart My pack of unruly hounds: I cannot start Them again on a quarry of knowledge they hate to hunt, I can haul them and urge them no more  No more can I endure to bear the brunt Of the books that lie out on the desks: a full three score Of several insults of blotted page and scrawl Of slovenly work that they have offered me  I am sick, and tired more than any thrall Upon the woodstacks working weariedly                                   And shall I take The last dear fuel and heap it on my soul Till I rouse my will like a fire to consume Their dross of indifference, and burn the scroll Of their insults in punishment?--I will not! I will not waste myself to embers for them, Not all for them shall the fires of my life be hot, For myself a heap of ashes of weariness, till sleep Shall have raked the embers clear: I will keep Some of my strength for myself, for if I should sell It all for them, I should hate them--             --I will sit and wait for the bell                  'T is little I could care for pearls   Who own the ample sea  Or brooches, when the Emperor   With rubies pelteth me   Or gold, who am the Prince of Mines    Or diamonds, when I see A diadem to fit a dome   Continual crowning me               Superiority to fate   Is difficult to learn  'T is not conferred by any,   But possible to earn  A pittance at a time,   Until, to her surprise, The soul with strict economy   Subsists till Paradise             Hope is a subtle glutton    He feeds upon the fair  And yet, inspected closely,   What abstinence is there!

The apple on the tree, Provided it do hopeless hang,   That 'heaven' is, to me   The color on the cruising cloud,   The interdicted ground Behind the hill, the house behind, --   There Paradise is found!         A    A word is dead When it is said,   Some say  I say it just Begins to live   That day          To venerate the simple days   Which lead the seasons by, Needs but to remember   That from you or me They may take the trifle   Termed mortality!  To invest existence with a stately air, Needs but to remember   That the acorn there Is the egg of forests   For the upper air!         'S    It's such a little thing to weep,   So short a thing to sigh  And yet by trades the size of these   We men and women die!         Drowning is not so pitiful   As the attempt to rise  Three times, 't is said, a sinking man   Comes up to face the skies, And then declines forever   To that abhorred abode Where hope and he part company, --   For he is grasped of God  The Maker's cordial visage,   However good to see, Is shunned, we must admit it,   Like an adversity       X   How still the bells in steeples stand,   Till, swollen with the sky, They leap upon their silver feet   In frantic melody!         If the foolish call them 'flowers,'   Need the wiser tell? If the savans 'classify' them,   It is just as well!  Those who read the Revelations   Must not criticise Those who read the same edition   With beclouded eyes!  Could we stand with that old Moses   Canaan denied, -- Scan, like him, the stately landscape   On the other side, --  Doubtless we should deem superfluous   Many sciences Not pursued by learnèd angels   In scholastic skies!  Low amid that glad _Belles lettres_   Grant that we may stand, Stars, amid profound Galaxies,   At that grand 'Right hand'!         A    Could mortal lip divine   The undeveloped freight Of a delivered syllable,   'T would crumble with the weight             My life closed twice before its close    It yet remains to see If Immortality unveil   A third event to me,  So huge, so hopeless to conceive,   As these that twice befell  Parting is all we know of heaven,   And all we need of hell             We never know how high we are   Till we are called to rise  And then, if we are true to plan,   Our statures touch the skies   The heroism we recite   Would be a daily thing, Did not ourselves the cubits warp   For fear to be a king              While I was fearing it, it came,   But came with less of fear, Because that fearing it so long   Had almost made it dear  There is a fitting a dismay,   A fitting a despair  'Tis harder knowing it is due,   Than knowing it is here  The trying on the utmost,   The morning it is new, Is terribler than wearing it   A whole existence through          A    There is no frigate like a book   To take us lands away, Nor any coursers like a page   Of prancing poetry  This traverse may the poorest take   Without oppress of toll  How frugal is the chariot   That bears a human soul!         Who has not found the heaven below   Will fail of it above  God's residence is next to mine,   His furniture is love          A    A face devoid of love or grace,   A hateful, hard, successful face, A face with which a stone   Would feel as thoroughly at ease As were they old acquaintances, --   First time together thrown          I  A     I had a guinea golden    I lost it in the sand, And though the sum was simple,   And pounds were in the land, Still had it such a value   Unto my frugal eye, That when I could not find it   I sat me down to sigh   I had a crimson robin   Who sang full many a day, But when the woods were painted   He, too, did fly away  Time brought me other robins, --   Their ballads were the same, -- Still for my missing troubadour   I kept the 'house at hame '  I had a star in heaven    One Pleiad was its name, And when I was not heeding   It wandered from the same  And though the skies are crowded,   And all the night ashine, I do not care about it,   Since none of them are mine   My story has a moral:   I have a missing friend, -- Pleiad its name, and robin,   And guinea in the sand, -- And when this mournful ditty,   Accompanied with tear, Shall meet the eye of traitor   In country far from here, Grant that repentance solemn   May seize upon his mind, And he no consolation   Beneath the sun may find     -This poem may have had, like many others, a personal origin  It is more than probable that it was sent to some friend travelling in Europe, a dainty reminder of letter-writing delinquencies              From all the jails the boys and girls   Ecstatically leap, -- Beloved, only afternoon   That prison doesn't keep   They storm the earth and stun the air,   A mob of solid bliss  Alas! that frowns could lie in wait   For such a foe as this!          Few get enough, -enough is one    To that ethereal throng Have not each one of us the right   To stealthily belong?         Upon the gallows hung a wretch,   Too sullied for the hell To which the law entitled him    As nature's curtain fell The one who bore him tottered in,   For this was woman's son  ''T was all I had,' she stricken gasped    Oh, what a livid boon!              I felt a clearing in my mind   As if my brain had split  I tried to match it, seam by seam,   But could not make them fit   The thought behind I strove to join   Unto the thought before, But sequence ravelled out of reach   Like balls upon a floor             The reticent volcano keeps   His never slumbering plan  Confided are his projects pink   To no precarious man   If nature will not tell the tale   Jehovah told to her, Can human nature not survive   Without a listener?  Admonished by her buckled lips   Let every babbler be  The only secret people keep   Is Immortality              If recollecting were forgetting,   Then I remember not  And if forgetting, recollecting,   How near I had forgot! And if to miss were merry,   And if to mourn were gay, How very blithe the fingers   That gathered these to-day!         The farthest thunder that I heard   Was nearer than the sky, And rumbles still, though torrid noons   Have lain their missiles by  The lightning that preceded it   Struck no one but myself, But I would not exchange the bolt   For all the rest of life  Indebtedness to oxygen   The chemist may repay, But not the obligation   To electricity  It founds the homes and decks the days,   And every clamor bright Is but the gleam concomitant   Of that waylaying light  The thought is quiet as a flake, --   A crash without a sound  How life's reverberation   Its explanation found!         On the bleakness of my lot   Bloom I strove to raise  Late, my acre of a rock   Yielded grape and maize   Soil of flint if steadfast tilled   Will reward the hand  Seed of palm by Lybian sun   Fructified in sand             A door just opened on a street --   I, lost, was passing by -- An instant's width of warmth disclosed,   And wealth, and company   The door as sudden shut, and I,   I, lost, was passing by, -- Lost doubly, but by contrast most,   Enlightening misery              Are friends delight or pain?   Could bounty but remain Riches were good   But if they only stay Bolder to fly away,   Riches are sad              Ashes denote that fire was    Respect the grayest pile For the departed creature's sake   That hovered there awhile   Fire exists the first in light,   And then consolidates, -- Only the chemist can disclose   Into what carbonates          A    Fate slew him, but he did not drop    She felled -he did not fall -- Impaled him on her fiercest stakes --   He neutralized them all   She stung him, sapped his firm advance,   But, when her worst was done, And he, unmoved, regarded her,   Acknowledged him a man             Finite to fail, but infinite to venture    For the one ship that struts the shore Many's the gallant, overwhelmed creature   Nodding in navies nevermore             I measure every grief I meet   With analytic eyes  I wonder if it weighs like mine,   Or has an easier size   I wonder if they bore it long,   Or did it just begin? I could not tell the date of mine,   It feels so old a pain   I wonder if it hurts to live,   And if they have to try, And whether, could they choose between,   They would not rather die   I wonder if when years have piled --   Some thousands -on the cause Of early hurt, if such a lapse   Could give them any pause   Or would they go on aching still   Through centuries above, Enlightened to a larger pain   By contrast with the love   The grieved are many, I am told    The reason deeper lies, -- Death is but one and comes but once,   And only nails the eyes   There's grief of want, and grief of cold, --   A sort they call 'despair ' There's banishment from native eyes,   In sight of native air   And though I may not guess the kind   Correctly, yet to me A piercing comfort it affords   In passing Calvary,  To note the fashions of the cross,   Of those that stand alone, Still fascinated to presume   That some are like my own          I have a king who does not speak  So, wondering, thro' the hours meek   I trudge the day away,-- Half glad when it is night and sleep, If, haply, thro' a dream to peep   In parlors shut by day   And if I do, when morning comes, It is as if a hundred drums   Did round my pillow roll, And shouts fill all my childish sky, And bells keep saying 'victory'   From steeples in my soul!  And if I don't, the little Bird Within the Orchard is not heard,   And I omit to pray, 'Father, thy will be done' to-day, For my will goes the other way,   And it were perjury!            It dropped so low in my regard   I heard it hit the ground, And go to pieces on the stones   At bottom of my mind   Yet blamed the fate that fractured, less   Than I reviled myself For entertaining plated wares   Upon my silver shelf              To lose one's faith surpasses   The loss of an estate, Because estates can be   Replenished, -faith cannot   Inherited with life,   Belief but once can be  Annihilate a single clause,   And Being's beggary              I had a daily bliss   I half indifferent viewed, Till sudden I perceived it stir, --   It grew as I pursued,  Till when, around a crag,   It wasted from my sight, Enlarged beyond my utmost scope,   I learned its sweetness right          I worked for chaff, and earning wheat   Was haughty and betrayed  What right had fields to arbitrate   In matters ratified?  I tasted wheat, -and hated chaff,   And thanked the ample friend  Wisdom is more becoming viewed   At distance than at hand          Life, and Death, and Giants   Such as these, are still  Minor apparatus, hopper of the mill, Beetle at the candle,   Or a fife's small fame, Maintain by accident   That they proclaim              Our lives are Swiss, --   So still, so cool,   Till, some odd afternoon, The Alps neglect their curtains,   And we look farther on   Italy stands the other side,   While, like a guard between, The solemn Alps, The siren Alps,   Forever intervene!            Remembrance has a rear and front, --   'T is something like a house  It has a garret also   For refuse and the mouse,  Besides, the deepest cellar   That ever mason hewed  Look to it, by its fathoms   Ourselves be not pursued          To hang our head ostensibly,   And subsequent to find That such was not the posture   Of our immortal mind,  Affords the sly presumption   That, in so dense a fuzz, You, too, take cobweb attitudes   Upon a plane of gauze!             The brain is wider than the sky,   For, put them side by side, The one the other will include   With ease, and you beside   The brain is deeper than the sea,   For, hold them, blue to blue, The one the other will absorb,   As sponges, buckets do   The brain is just the weight of God,   For, lift them, pound for pound, And they will differ, if they do,   As syllable from sound          The bone that has no marrow    What ultimate for that? It is not fit for table,   For beggar, or for cat   A bone has obligations,   A being has the same  A marrowless assembly   Is culpabler than shame   But how shall finished creatures   A function fresh obtain? -- Old Nicodemus' phantom   Confronting us again!             The past is such a curious creature,   To look her in the face A transport may reward us,   Or a disgrace   Unarmed if any meet her,   I charge him, fly! Her rusty ammunition   Might yet reply!         To help our bleaker parts   Salubrious hours are given, Which if they do not fit for earth   Drill silently for heaven          What soft, cherubic creatures   These gentlewomen are! One would as soon assault a plush   Or violate a star   Such dimity convictions,   A horror so refined Of freckled human nature,   Of Deity ashamed, --  It's such a common glory,   A fisherman's degree! Redemption, brittle lady,   Be so, ashamed of thee             Who never wanted, -maddest joy   Remains to him unknown: The banquet of abstemiousness   Surpasses that of wine   Within its hope, though yet ungrasped   Desire's perfect goal, No nearer, lest reality   Should disenthrall thy soul             It might be easier   To fail with land in sight, Than gain my blue peninsula   To perish of delight       L      You cannot put a fire out    A thing that can ignite Can go, itself, without a fan   Upon the slowest night   You cannot fold a flood   And put it in a drawer, -- Because the winds would find it out,   And tell your cedar floor          A modest lot, a fame petite,   A brief campaign of sting and sweet   Is plenty! Is enough! A sailor's business is the shore,   A soldier's -balls  Who asketh more Must seek the neighboring life!         Is bliss, then, such abyss I must not put my foot amiss For fear I spoil my shoe?  I'd rather suit my foot Than save my boot, For yet to buy another pair Is possible At any fair   But bliss is sold just once  The patent lost None buy it any more             I stepped from plank to plank   So slow and cautiously  The stars about my head I felt,   About my feet the sea   I knew not but the next   Would be my final inch, -- This gave me that precarious gait   Some call experience              One day is there of the series   Termed Thanksgiving day, Celebrated part at table,   Part in memory   Neither patriarch nor pussy,   I dissect the play  Seems it, to my hooded thinking,   Reflex holiday   Had there been no sharp subtraction   From the early sum, Not an acre or a caption   Where was once a room,  Not a mention, whose small pebble   Wrinkled any bay, -- Unto such, were such assembly,   'T were Thanksgiving day              Softened by Time's consummate plush,   How sleek the woe appears That threatened childhood's citadel   And undermined the years!

Summer for thee grant I may be   When summer days are flown! Thy music still when whippoorwill   And oriole are done!  For thee to bloom, I'll skip the tomb   And sow my blossoms o'er! Pray gather me, Anemone,   Thy flower forevermore!

To lose thee, sweeter than to gain   All other hearts I knew  'T is true the drought is destitute,   But then I had the dew!

Then dinna care!    Proud little heart!   Did they forsake thee? Be debonair! Be debonair!    Frail little heart!   I would not break thee: Could'st credit me? Could'st credit me?    Gay little heart!   Like morning glory Thou'll wilted be  thou'll wilted be!

Behold the keenest marksman!   The most accomplished shot! Time's sublimest target   Is a soul 'forgot'!         I've got an arrow here    Loving the hand that sent it, I the dart revere   Fell, they will say, in 'skirmish'!   Vanquished, my soul will know, By but a simple arrow   Sped by an archer's bow              He fumbles at your spirit   As players at the keys Before they drop full music on    He stuns you by degrees,  Prepares your brittle substance   For the ethereal blow, By fainter hammers, further heard,   Then nearer, then so slow  Your breath has time to straighten,   Your brain to bubble cool, -- Deals one imperial thunderbolt   That scalps your naked soul          Heart, we will forget him!   You and I, to-night! You may forget the warmth he gave,   I will forget the light   When you have done, pray tell me,   That I my thoughts may dim  Haste! lest while you're lagging,   I may remember him!         Father, I bring thee not myself, --   That were the little load  I bring thee the imperial heart   I had not strength to hold   The heart I cherished in my own   Till mine too heavy grew, Yet strangest, heavier since it went,   Is it too large for you?         We outgrow love like other things   And put it in the drawer, Till it an antique fashion shows   Like costumes grandsires wore          Not with a club the heart is broken,     Nor with a stone  A whip, so small you could not see it      I've known  To lash the magic creature     Till it fell, Yet that whip's name too noble     Then to tell   Magnanimous of bird     By boy descried, To sing unto the stone     Of which it died          ?  My friend must be a bird,     Because it flies! Mortal my friend must be,     Because it dies! Barbs has it, like a bee  Ah, curious friend,     Thou puzzlest me!         He touched me, so I live to know That such a day, permitted so,   I groped upon his breast  It was a boundless place to me, And silenced, as the awful sea   Puts minor streams to rest   And now, I'm different from before, As if I breathed superior air,   Or brushed a royal gown  My feet, too, that had wandered so, My gypsy face transfigured now   To tenderer renown             Let me not mar that perfect dream   By an auroral stain, But so adjust my daily night   That it will come again              I live with him, I see his face    I go no more away For visitor, or sundown    Death's single privacy,  The only one forestalling mine,   And that by right that he Presents a claim invisible,   No wedlock granted me   I live with him, I hear his voice,   I stand alive to-day To witness to the certainty   Of immortality  Taught me by Time, -the lower way,   Conviction every day, -- That life like this is endless,   Be judgment what it may             I envy seas whereon he rides,   I envy spokes of wheels Of chariots that him convey,   I envy speechless hills  That gaze upon his journey    How easy all can see What is forbidden utterly   As heaven, unto me!  I envy nests of sparrows   That dot his distant eaves, The wealthy fly upon his pane,   The happy, happy leaves  That just abroad his window   Have summer's leave to be, The earrings of Pizarro   Could not obtain for me   I envy light that wakes him,   And bells that boldly ring To tell him it is noon abroad, --   Myself his noon could bring,  Yet interdict my blossom   And abrogate my bee, Lest noon in everlasting night   Drop Gabriel and me             A solemn thing it was, I said,   A woman white to be, And wear, if God should count me fit,   Her hallowed mystery   A timid thing to drop a life   Into the purple well, Too plummetless that it come back   Eternity until                 I   'S    The springtime's pallid landscape   Will glow like bright bouquet, Though drifted deep in parian   The village lies to-day   The lilacs, bending many a year,   With purple load will hang  The bees will not forget the tune   Their old forefathers sang   The rose will redden in the bog,   The aster on the hill Her everlasting fashion set,   And covenant gentians frill,  Till summer folds her miracle   As women do their gown, Or priests adjust the symbols   When sacrament is done              She slept beneath a tree   Remembered but by me  I touched her cradle mute  She recognized the foot, Put on her carmine suit, --   And see!         A light exists in spring   Not present on the year At any other period    When March is scarcely here  A color stands abroad   On solitary hills That science cannot overtake,   But human nature feels   It waits upon the lawn    It shows the furthest tree Upon the furthest slope we know    It almost speaks to me   Then, as horizons step,   Or noons report away, Without the formula of sound,   It passes, and we stay:  A quality of loss   Affecting our content, As trade had suddenly encroached   Upon a sacrament               A lady red upon the hill   Her annual secret keeps  A lady white within the field   In placid lily sleeps!  The tidy breezes with their brooms   Sweep vale, and hill, and tree! Prithee, my pretty housewives!   Who may expected be?  The neighbors do not yet suspect!   The woods exchange a smile -- Orchard, and buttercup, and bird --   In such a little while!  And yet how still the landscape stands,   How nonchalant the wood, As if the resurrection   Were nothing very odd!      V       Dear March, come in! How glad I am! I looked for you before  Put down your hat -- You must have walked -- How out of breath you are! Dear March, how are you? And the rest? Did you leave Nature well? Oh, March, come right upstairs with me, I have so much to tell!  I got your letter, and the birds'  The maples never knew That you were coming, -I declare, How red their faces grew! But, March, forgive me -- And all those hills You left for me to hue  There was no purple suitable, You took it all with you   Who knocks? That April! Lock the door! I will not be pursued! He stayed away a year, to call When I am occupied  But trifles look so trivial As soon as you have come, That blame is just as dear as praise And praise as mere as blame             We like March, his shoes are purple,   He is new and high  Makes he mud for dog and peddler,   Makes he forest dry  Knows the adder's tongue his coming,   And begets her spot  Stands the sun so close and mighty   That our minds are hot  News is he of all the others    Bold it were to die With the blue-birds buccaneering   On his British sky            Not knowing when the dawn will come   I open every door  Or has it feathers like a bird,   Or billows like a shore?         A murmur in the trees to note,   Not loud enough for wind  A star not far enough to seek,   Nor near enough to find   A long, long yellow on the lawn,   A hubbub as of feet  Not audible, as ours to us,   But dapperer, more sweet   A hurrying home of little men   To houses unperceived, -- All this, and more, if I should tell,   Would never be believed   Of robins in the trundle bed   How many I espy Whose nightgowns could not hide the wings,   Although I heard them try!  But then I promised ne'er to tell    How could I break my word? So go your way and I'll go mine, --   No fear you'll miss the road          Morning is the place for dew,   Corn is made at noon, After dinner light for flowers,   Dukes for setting sun!      X   To my quick ear the leaves conferred    The bushes they were bells  I could not find a privacy   From Nature's sentinels   In cave if I presumed to hide,   The walls began to tell  Creation seemed a mighty crack   To make me visible          A    A sepal, petal, and a thorn   Upon a common summer's morn, A flash of dew, a bee or two, A breeze A caper in the trees, --   And I'm a rose!         High from the earth I heard a bird    He trod upon the trees As he esteemed them trifles,   And then he spied a breeze, And situated softly   Upon a pile of wind Which in a perturbation   Nature had left behind  A joyous-going fellow   I gathered from his talk, Which both of benediction   And badinage partook, Without apparent burden,   I learned, in leafy wood He was the faithful father   Of a dependent brood  And this untoward transport   His remedy for care, -- A contrast to our respites    How different we are!            The spider as an artist   Has never been employed Though his surpassing merit   Is freely certified  By every broom and Bridget   Throughout a Christian land  Neglected son of genius,   I take thee by the hand          A    What mystery pervades a well!   The water lives so far, Like neighbor from another world   Residing in a jar   The grass does not appear afraid    I often wonder he Can stand so close and look so bold   At what is dread to me   Related somehow they may be, --   The sedge stands next the sea, Where he is floorless, yet of fear   No evidence gives he   But nature is a stranger yet    The ones that cite her most Have never passed her haunted house,   Nor simplified her ghost   To pity those that know her not   Is helped by the regret That those who know her, know her less   The nearer her they get          To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, -- One clover, and a bee, And revery  The revery alone will do If bees are few              It's like the light, --   A fashionless delight It's like the bee, --   A dateless melody   It's like the woods,   Private like breeze, Phraseless, yet it stirs   The proudest trees   It's like the morning, --   Best when it's done, -- The everlasting clocks   Chime noon          A dew sufficed itself   And satisfied a leaf, And felt, 'how vast a destiny!   How trivial is life!'  The sun went out to work,   The day went out to play, But not again that dew was seen   By physiognomy   Whether by day abducted,   Or emptied by the sun Into the sea, in passing,   Eternally unknown              His bill an auger is,   His head, a cap and frill  He laboreth at every tree, --   A worm his utmost goal          A    Sweet is the swamp with its secrets,   Until we meet a snake  'T is then we sigh for houses,   And our departure take At that enthralling gallop   That only childhood knows  A snake is summer's treason,   And guile is where it goes          Could I but ride indefinite,   As doth the meadow-bee, And visit only where I liked,   And no man visit me,  And flirt all day with buttercups,   And marry whom I may, And dwell a little everywhere,   Or better, run away  With no police to follow,   Or chase me if I do, Till I should jump peninsulas   To get away from you, --  I said, but just to be a bee   Upon a raft of air, And row in nowhere all day long,   And anchor off the bar,-- What liberty! So captives deem   Who tight in dungeons are              The moon was but a chin of gold   A night or two ago, And now she turns her perfect face   Upon the world below   Her forehead is of amplest blond    Her cheek like beryl stone  Her eye unto the summer dew   The likest I have known   Her lips of amber never part    But what must be the smile Upon her friend she could bestow   Were such her silver will!  And what a privilege to be   But the remotest star! For certainly her way might pass   Beside your twinkling door   Her bonnet is the firmament,   The universe her shoe, The stars the trinkets at her belt,   Her dimities of blue              The bat is dun with wrinkled wings   Like fallow article, And not a song pervades his lips,   Or none perceptible   His small umbrella, quaintly halved,   Describing in the air An arc alike inscrutable, --   Elate philosopher!  Deputed from what firmament   Of what astute abode, Empowered with what malevolence   Auspiciously withheld   To his adroit Creator   Ascribe no less the praise  Beneficent, believe me,   His eccentricities              You've seen balloons set, haven't you?   So stately they ascend It is as swans discarded you   For duties diamond   Their liquid feet go softly out   Upon a sea of blond  They spurn the air as 't were too mean   For creatures so renowned   Their ribbons just beyond the eye,   They struggle some for breath, And yet the crowd applauds below    They would not encore death   The gilded creature strains and spins,   Trips frantic in a tree, Tears open her imperial veins   And tumbles in the sea   The crowd retire with an oath   The dust in streets goes down, And clerks in counting-rooms observe,   ''T was only a balloon '            The cricket sang, And set the sun, And workmen finished, one by one,   Their seam the day upon   The low grass loaded with the dew, The twilight stood as strangers do With hat in hand, polite and new,   To stay as if, or go   A vastness, as a neighbor, came, -- A wisdom without face or name, A peace, as hemispheres at home, --   And so the night became             Drab habitation of whom? Tabernacle or tomb, Or dome of worm, Or porch of gnome, Or some elf's catacomb?           A sloop of amber slips away   Upon an ether sea, And wrecks in peace a purple tar,   The son of ecstasy             Of bronze and blaze   The north, to-night!   So adequate its forms, So preconcerted with itself,   So distant to alarms, -- An unconcern so sovereign   To universe, or me, It paints my simple spirit   With tints of majesty, Till I take vaster attitudes,   And strut upon my stem, Disdaining men and oxygen,   For arrogance of them   My splendors are menagerie    But their competeless show Will entertain the centuries   When I am, long ago, An island in dishonored grass,   Whom none but daisies know                How the old mountains drip with sunset,   And the brake of dun! How the hemlocks are tipped in tinsel   By the wizard sun!  How the old steeples hand the scarlet,   Till the ball is full, -- Have I the lip of the flamingo   That I dare to tell?  Then, how the fire ebbs like billows,   Touching all the grass With a departing, sapphire feature,   As if a duchess pass!  How a small dusk crawls on the village   Till the houses blot  And the odd flambeaux no men carry   Glimmer on the spot!  Now it is night in nest and kennel,   And where was the wood, Just a dome of abyss is nodding   Into solitude! --  These are the visions baffled Guido    Titian never told  Domenichino dropped the pencil,   Powerless to unfold             The murmuring of bees has ceased    But murmuring of some Posterior, prophetic,   Has simultaneous come, --  The lower metres of the year,   When nature's laugh is done, -- The Revelations of the book   Whose Genesis is June              I   This world is not conclusion    A sequel stands beyond, Invisible, as music,   But positive, as sound  It beckons and it baffles    Philosophies don't know, And through a riddle, at the last,   Sagacity must go  To guess it puzzles scholars    To gain it, men have shown Contempt of generations,   And crucifixion known          We learn in the retreating   How vast an one Was recently among us    A perished sun  Endears in the departure   How doubly more Than all the golden presence   It was before!         They say that 'time assuages,' --   Time never did assuage  An actual suffering strengthens,   As sinews do, with age   Time is a test of trouble,   But not a remedy  If such it prove, it prove too   There was no malady          We cover thee, sweet face    Not that we tire of thee, But that thyself fatigue of us    Remember, as thou flee, We follow thee until   Thou notice us no more, And then, reluctant, turn away   To con thee o'er and o'er, And blame the scanty love   We were content to show, Augmented, sweet, a hundred fold   If thou would'st take it now       V      That is solemn we have ended, --   Be it but a play, Or a glee among the garrets,   Or a holiday,  Or a leaving home  or later,   Parting with a world We have understood, for better   Still it be unfurled          The stimulus, beyond the grave   His countenance to see, Supports me like imperial drams   Afforded royally          Given in marriage unto thee,   Oh, thou celestial host! Bride of the Father and the Son,   Bride of the Holy Ghost!  Other betrothal shall dissolve,   Wedlock of will decay  Only the keeper of this seal   Conquers mortality           That such have died enables us   The tranquiller to die  That such have lived, certificate   For immortality          They won't frown always, -some sweet day   When I forget to tease, They'll recollect how cold I looked,   And how I just said 'please '  Then they will hasten to the door   To call the little child, Who cannot thank them, for the ice   That on her lisping piled       X      It is an honorable thought,   And makes one lift one's hat, As one encountered gentlefolk   Upon a daily street,  That we've immortal place,   Though pyramids decay, And kingdoms, like the orchard,   Flit russetly away          The distance that the dead have gone   Does not at first appear  Their coming back seems possible   For many an ardent year   And then, that we have followed them   We more than half suspect, So intimate have we become   With their dear retrospect          How dare the robins sing,   When men and women hear Who since they went to their account   Have settled with the year! -- Paid all that life had earned   In one consummate bill, And now, what life or death can do   Is immaterial  Insulting is the sun   To him whose mortal light, Beguiled of immortality,   Bequeaths him to the night  In deference to him   Extinct be every hum, Whose garden wrestles with the dew,   At daybreak overcome!            Death is like the insect   Menacing the tree, Competent to kill it,   But decoyed may be   Bait it with the balsam,   Seek it with the knife, Baffle, if it cost you   Everything in life   Then, if it have burrowed   Out of reach of skill, Ring the tree and leave it, --   'T is the vermin's will             'T is sunrise, little maid, hast thou   No station in the day? 'T was not thy wont to hinder so, --   Retrieve thine industry   'T is noon, my little maid, alas!   And art thou sleeping yet? The lily waiting to be wed,   The bee, dost thou forget?  My little maid, 't is night  alas,   That night should be to thee Instead of morning! Hadst thou broached   Thy little plan to me, Dissuade thee if I could not, sweet,   I might have aided thee          Each that we lose takes part of us    A crescent still abides, Which like the moon, some turbid night,   Is summoned by the tides          Not any higher stands the grave   For heroes than for men  Not any nearer for the child   Than numb three-score and ten   This latest leisure equal lulls   The beggar and his queen  Propitiate this democrat   By summer's gracious mien             As far from pity as complaint,   As cool to speech as stone, As numb to revelation   As if my trade were bone   As far from time as history,   As near yourself to-day As children to the rainbow's scarf,   Or sunset's yellow play  To eyelids in the sepulchre    How still the dancer lies, While color's revelations break,   And blaze the butterflies!             'T is whiter than an Indian pipe,   'T is dimmer than a lace  No stature has it, like a fog,   When you approach the place   Not any voice denotes it here,   Or intimates it there  A spirit, how doth it accost?   What customs hath the air?  This limitless hyperbole   Each one of us shall be  'T is drama, if (hypothesis)   It be not tragedy!             She laid her docile crescent down,   And this mechanic stone Still states, to dates that have forgot,   The news that she is gone   So constant to its stolid trust,   The shaft that never knew, It shames the constancy that fled   Before its emblem flew          Bless God, he went as soldiers,   His musket on his breast  Grant, God, he charge the bravest   Of all the martial blest   Please God, might I behold him   In epauletted white, I should not fear the foe then,   I should not fear the fight          Immortal is an ample word   When what we need is by, But when it leaves us for a time,   'T is a necessity   Of heaven above the firmest proof   We fundamental know, Except for its marauding hand,   It had been heaven below          Where every bird is bold to go,   And bees abashless play, The foreigner before he knocks   Must thrust the tears away          The grave my little cottage is,   Where, keeping house for thee, I make my parlor orderly,   And lay the marble tea,  For two divided, briefly,   A cycle, it may be, Till everlasting life unite   In strong society          This was in the white of the year,   That was in the green, Drifts were as difficult then to think   As daisies now to be seen   Looking back is best that is left,   Or if it be before, Retrospection is prospect's half,   Sometimes almost more          Sweet hours have perished here    This is a mighty room  Within its precincts hopes have played, --   Now shadows in the tomb          Me! Come! My dazzled face In such a shining place!  Me! Hear! My foreign ear The sounds of welcome near!  The saints shall meet Our bashful feet   My holiday shall be That they remember me   My paradise, the fame That they pronounce my name             From us she wandered now a year,   Her tarrying unknown  If wilderness prevent her feet,   Or that ethereal zone  No eye hath seen and lived,   We ignorant must be  We only know what time of year   We took the mystery           I wish I knew that woman's name,   So, when she comes this way, To hold my life, and hold my ears,   For fear I hear her say  She's 'sorry I am dead,' again,   Just when the grave and I Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep, --   Our only lullaby               Bereaved of all, I went abroad,   No less bereaved to be Upon a new peninsula, --   The grave preceded me,  Obtained my lodgings ere myself,   And when I sought my bed, The grave it was, reposed upon   The pillow for my head   I waked, to find it first awake,   I rose, -it followed me  I tried to drop it in the crowd,   To lose it in the sea,  In cups of artificial drowse   To sleep its shape away, -- The grave was finished, but the spade   Remained in memory          I felt a funeral in my brain,   And mourners, to and fro, Kept treading, treading, till it seemed   That sense was breaking through   And when they all were seated,   A service like a drum Kept beating, beating, till I thought   My mind was going numb   And then I heard them lift a box,   And creak across my soul With those same boots of lead, again    Then space began to toll  As all the heavens were a bell,   And Being but an ear, And I and silence some strange race,   Wrecked, solitary, here          I meant to find her when I came    Death had the same design  But the success was his, it seems,   And the discomfit mine   I meant to tell her how I longed   For just this single time  But Death had told her so the first,   And she had hearkened him   To wander now is my abode    To rest, -to rest would be A privilege of hurricane   To memory and me             I sing to use the waiting,   My bonnet but to tie, And shut the door unto my house    No more to do have I,  Till, his best step approaching,   We journey to the day, And tell each other how we sang   To keep the dark away          A sickness of this world it most occasions   When best men die  A wishfulness their far condition   To occupy   A chief indifference, as foreign   A world must be Themselves forsake contented,   For Deity          Superfluous were the sun   When excellence is dead  He were superfluous every day,   For every day is said  That syllable whose faith   Just saves it from despair, And whose 'I'll meet you' hesitates   If love inquire, 'Where?'  Upon his dateless fame   Our periods may lie, As stars that drop anonymous   From an abundant sky          So proud she was to die   It made us all ashamed That what we cherished, so unknown   To her desire seemed   So satisfied to go   Where none of us should be, Immediately, that anguish stooped   Almost to jealousy             Tie the strings to my life, my Lord,   Then I am ready to go! Just a look at the horses --   Rapid! That will do!  Put me in on the firmest side,   So I shall never fall  For we must ride to the Judgment,   And it's partly down hill   But never I mind the bridges,   And never I mind the sea  Held fast in everlasting race   By my own choice and thee   Good-by to the life I used to live,   And the world I used to know  And kiss the hills for me, just once    Now I am ready to go!         The dying need but little, dear, --   A glass of water's all, A flower's unobtrusive face   To punctuate the wall,  A fan, perhaps, a friend's regret,   And certainly that one No color in the rainbow   Perceives when you are gone             There's something quieter than sleep   Within this inner room! It wears a sprig upon its breast,   And will not tell its name   Some touch it and some kiss it,   Some chafe its idle hand  It has a simple gravity   I do not understand!  While simple-hearted neighbors   Chat of the 'early dead,' We, prone to periphrasis,   Remark that birds have fled!         The soul should always stand ajar,   That if the heaven inquire, He will not be obliged to wait,   Or shy of troubling her   Depart, before the host has slid   The bolt upon the door, To seek for the accomplished guest, --   Her visitor no more          Three weeks passed since I had seen her, --   Some disease had vexed  'T was with text and village singing   I beheld her next,  And a company -our pleasure   To discourse alone  Gracious now to me as any,   Gracious unto none   Borne, without dissent of either,   To the parish night  Of the separated people   Which are out of sight?         I breathed enough to learn the trick,   And now, removed from air, I simulate the breath so well,   That one, to be quite sure  The lungs are stirless, must descend   Among the cunning cells, And touch the pantomime himself    How cool the bellows feels!         I wonder if the sepulchre   Is not a lonesome way, When men and boys, and larks and June   Go down the fields to hay!              If tolling bell I ask the cause    'A soul has gone to God,' I'm answered in a lonesome tone    Is heaven then so sad?  That bells should joyful ring to tell   A soul had gone to heaven, Would seem to me the proper way   A good news should be given          If I may have it when it's dead   I will contented be  If just as soon as breath is out   It shall belong to me,  Until they lock it in the grave,   'T is bliss I cannot weigh, For though they lock thee in the grave,   Myself can hold the key   Think of it, lover! I and thee   Permitted face to face to be  After a life, a death we'll say, --   For death was that, and this is thee          Before the ice is in the pools,   Before the skaters go, Or any cheek at nightfall   Is tarnished by the snow,  Before the fields have finished,   Before the Christmas tree, Wonder upon wonder   Will arrive to me!  What we touch the hems of   On a summer's day  What is only walking   Just a bridge away   That which sings so, speaks so,   When there's no one here, -- Will the frock I wept in   Answer me to wear?            I heard a fly buzz when I died    The stillness round my form Was like the stillness in the air   Between the heaves of storm   The eyes beside had wrung them dry,   And breaths were gathering sure For that last onset, when the king   Be witnessed in his power   I willed my keepsakes, signed away   What portion of me I Could make assignable, -and then   There interposed a fly,  With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,   Between the light and me  And then the windows failed, and then   I could not see to see          Adrift! A little boat adrift!   And night is coming down! Will no one guide a little boat   Unto the nearest town?  So sailors say, on yesterday,   Just as the dusk was brown, One little boat gave up its strife,   And gurgled down and down   But angels say, on yesterday,   Just as the dawn was red, One little boat o'erspent with gales Retrimmed its masts, redecked its sails   Exultant, onward sped!         There's been a death in the opposite house   As lately as to-day  I know it by the numb look   Such houses have alway   The neighbors rustle in and out,   The doctor drives away  A window opens like a pod,   Abrupt, mechanically   Somebody flings a mattress out, --   The children hurry by  They wonder if It died on that, --   I used to when a boy   The minister goes stiffly in   As if the house were his, And he owned all the mourners now,   And little boys besides   And then the milliner, and the man   Of the appalling trade, To take the measure of the house    There'll be that dark parade  Of tassels and of coaches soon    It's easy as a sign, -- The intuition of the news   In just a country town          We never know we go, -when we are going   We jest and shut the door  Fate following behind us bolts it,   And we accost no more      L    'S    It struck me every day   The lightning was as new As if the cloud that instant slit   And let the fire through   It burned me in the night,   It blistered in my dream  It sickened fresh upon my sight   With every morning's beam   I thought that storm was brief, --   The maddest, quickest by  But Nature lost the date of this,   And left it in the sky          Water is taught by thirst  Land, by the oceans passed    Transport, by throe  Peace, by its battles told  Love, by memorial mould    Birds, by the snow            We thirst at first, -'t is Nature's act    And later, when we die, A little water supplicate   Of fingers going by   It intimates the finer want,   Whose adequate supply Is that great water in the west   Termed immortality          A clock stopped -not the mantel's    Geneva's farthest skill Can't put the puppet bowing   That just now dangled still   An awe came on the trinket!   The figures hunched with pain, Then quivered out of decimals   Into degreeless noon   It will not stir for doctors,   This pendulum of snow  The shopman importunes it,   While cool, concernless No  Nods from the gilded pointers,   Nods from the seconds slim, Decades of arrogance between   The dial life and him           Ë'S    All overgrown by cunning moss,   All interspersed with weed, The little cage of 'Currer Bell,'   In quiet Haworth laid   This bird, observing others,   When frosts too sharp became, Retire to other latitudes,   Quietly did the same,  But differed in returning    Since Yorkshire hills are green, Yet not in all the nests I meet   Can nightingale be seen   Gathered from many wanderings,   Gethsemane can tell Through what transporting anguish   She reached the asphodel!  Soft fall the sounds of Eden   Upon her puzzled ear  Oh, what an afternoon for heaven,   When 'Brontë' entered there!         A toad can die of light! Death is the common right   Of toads and men, -- Of earl and midge The privilege    Why swagger then? The gnat's supremacy Is large as thine          Far from love the Heavenly Father   Leads the chosen child  Oftener through realm of briar   Than the meadow mild,  Oftener by the claw of dragon   Than the hand of friend, Guides the little one predestined   To the native land             A long, long sleep, a famous sleep   That makes no show for dawn By stretch of limb or stir of lid, --   An independent one   Was ever idleness like this?   Within a hut of stone To bask the centuries away   Nor once look up for noon?            'T was just this time last year I died    I know I heard the corn, When I was carried by the farms, --   It had the tassels on   I thought how yellow it would look   When Richard went to mill  And then I wanted to get out,   But something held my will   I thought just how red apples wedged   The stubble's joints between  And carts went stooping round the fields   To take the pumpkins in   I wondered which would miss me least,   And when Thanksgiving came, If father'd multiply the plates   To make an even sum   And if my stocking hung too high,   Would it blur the Christmas glee, That not a Santa Claus could reach   The altitude of me?  But this sort grieved myself, and so   I thought how it would be When just this time, some perfect year,   Themselves should come to me             On this wondrous sea, Sailing silently,   Ho! pilot, ho! Knowest thou the shore Where no breakers roar,   Where the storm is o'er?  In the silent west Many sails at rest,   Their anchors fast  Thither I pilot thee, -- Land, ho! Eternity!   Ashore at last!
